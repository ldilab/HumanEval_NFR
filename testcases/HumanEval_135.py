# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it is 3
assert can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == 3, 'Failed to find the largest index.'

### All elements in the array are greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it
### Therefore, the function should return -1
assert can_arrange([1, 2, 3]) == -1, 'Failed to handle case where no such element exists.'

## Edge Cases
### The input array is empty, so the function should return -1
assert can_arrange([]) == -1, 'Failed to handle an empty input array.'

### The input array has only one element, so the function should return -1
assert can_arrange([5]) == -1, 'Failed to handle case where the input array has only one element.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The arr list contains 10^6 elements with increasing values from 1 to 10^6
### All elements in the array are greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it
### Therefore, the function should return -1
assert can_arrange(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) == -1, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The arr list contains 10^6 elements with decreasing values from 10^6 to 1
### The largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it is 10**6 - 1
assert can_arrange(list(range(10**6, 0, -1))) == 10**6 - 1, 'Failed to handle case where all elements in the array are greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.'

### The arr list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1
### All elements in the array are greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it
### Therefore, the function should return -1
assert can_arrange([1] * 10**6) == -1, 'Failed to handle case where all elements in the array are equal.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The arr input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not can_arrange('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input arr is not a list.'

#### The arr list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not can_arrange([1, 'invalid', 3, 4, 5]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(can_arrange))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
