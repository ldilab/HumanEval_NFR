# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The even elements at odd indices are [2]
### The sum of these elements is 2
assert add([4, 2, 6, 7]) == 2, 'Failed to calculate the sum of even elements at odd indices.'

### The even elements at odd indices are [10, 8, 6]
### The sum of these elements is 24
assert add([1, 10, 2, 8, 3, 6]) == 24, 'Failed to calculate the sum of even elements at odd indices.'

## Edge Cases
### There are no even elements at odd indices, so the function should return 0
assert add([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where there are no even elements at odd indices.'

### The lst input has no odd indices, so the function should return 0
assert add([14]) == 0, 'Failed to handle a length-1 list.'

### The lst input is an empty list, so the function should return 0
assert add([]) == 0, 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The lst list contains 10^6 elements with alternating odd and even elements
### The even elements at odd indices are [2, 4, 6, ..., 10^6]
### The sum of these elements is 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 10^6 = 250000500000
assert add(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) == 250000500000, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The lst input is not a list, so the function should return 0
assert not add('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input lst is not a list.'

#### The lst list contains elements that are not integers, but they are at odd indices
### The even elements at odd indices are [2, 4, 6, 8]
### The sum of these elements is 20
assert add([1, 2, 'invalid', 4, 5, 6, 'invalid', 8]) == 20, 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
