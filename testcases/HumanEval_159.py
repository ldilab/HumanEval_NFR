# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The initial number of eaten carrots is 5.
### The number of carrots needed to be eaten is 6.
### There are 10 remaining carrots.
### The total number of eaten carrots after meals is 11.
### The number of carrots left after meals is 4.
assert eat(5, 6, 10) == [11, 4], 'Failed to calculate the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left after meals.'

### The initial number of eaten carrots is 4.
### The number of carrots needed to be eaten is 8.
### There are 9 remaining carrots.
### The total number of eaten carrots after meals is 12.
### The number of carrots left after meals is 1.
assert eat(4, 8, 9) == [12, 1], 'Failed to calculate the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left after meals.'

### The initial number of eaten carrots is 1.
### The number of carrots needed to be eaten is 10.
### There are 10 remaining carrots.
### The total number of eaten carrots after meals is 11.
### The number of carrots left after meals is 0.
assert eat(1, 10, 10) == [11, 0], 'Failed to calculate the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left after meals.'

### The initial number of eaten carrots is 2.
### The number of carrots needed to be eaten is 11.
### There are 5 remaining carrots.
### The total number of eaten carrots after meals is 7.
### The number of carrots left after meals is 0.
assert eat(2, 11, 5) == [7, 0], 'Failed to calculate the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left after meals.'

## Edge Cases
### All inputs are zero, so the function should return [0, 0]
assert eat(0, 0, 0) == [0, 0], 'Failed to handle case where all inputs are zero.'

### The initial number of eaten carrots is zero.
### The number of carrots needed to be eaten is zero.
### There are 10 remaining carrots.
### The total number of eaten carrots after meals is 0.
### The number of carrots left after meals is 10.
assert eat(0, 0, 10) == [0, 10], 'Failed to handle case where the number of carrots needed is zero.'

### The initial number of eaten carrots is zero.
### The number of carrots needed to be eaten is 10.
### There are zero remaining carrots.
### The total number of eaten carrots after meals is 0.
### The number of carrots left after meals is 0.
assert eat(0, 10, 0) == [0, 0], 'Failed to handle case where there are no remaining carrots.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The function has constant time complexity since it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input.
assert eat(500, 500, 500) == [1000, 0], 'Failed to handle input within the performance requirements.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input number is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not eat('invalid', 10, 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input number is not an integer.'

#### The input need is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not eat(2, 'invalid', 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input need is not an integer.'

#### The input remaining is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not eat(2, 10, 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input remaining is not an integer.'

#### The input number is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not eat(-5, 10, 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input number is negative.'

#### The input need is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not eat(5, -10, 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input need is negative.'

#### The input remaining is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not eat(5, 10, -5), 'Failed to handle case where the input remaining is negative.'

#### The input number is greater than 1000, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not eat(1001, 10, 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input number is greater than 1000.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(eat))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
