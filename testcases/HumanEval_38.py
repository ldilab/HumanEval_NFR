# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## encode_cyclic
### General Cases
#### The string "abcdef" can be split into the groups ["abc", "def"]
#### The first group should be encoded as "bca", and the second group should be encoded as "efd"
#### The encoded string should be "bcaefd"
assert encode_cyclic("abcdef") == "bcaefd", 'Failed to encode the string with groups of three characters.'

#### The string "abcdefgh" can be split into the groups ["abc", "def", "gh"]
#### The first group should be encoded as "bca", the second group as "efd", and the third group remains the same
#### The encoded string should be "bcaefdgh"
assert encode_cyclic("abcdefgh") == "bcaefdgh", 'Failed to encode the string with groups of three characters.'

### Edge Cases
#### The input string is empty, so the function should return an empty string
assert encode_cyclic("") == "", 'Failed to handle an empty input string.'

#### The input string has length less than 3, so the function should return the original string
assert encode_cyclic("a") == "a", 'Failed to handle a string with length less than 3.'

#### The input string has length less than 3, so the function should return the original string
assert encode_cyclic("ab") == "ab", 'Failed to handle a string with length less than 3.'

## decode_cyclic
### Not implemented yet, so no test cases available

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input string has length 10^6, with characters repeated in groups of 3
### The encoded string should be the same as the input string
assert encode_cyclic("abc" * 10**6) == "bca" * 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not encode_cyclic(123), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a string.'

#### The input string contains non-ascii characters, so the function should handle them correctly
assert encode_cyclic("こんにちは") == "んにこちは", 'Failed to handle non-ascii characters in the input string.'

#### The input string has leading/trailing whitespace, so the function should handle them correctly
assert encode_cyclic("  abc ") == " a c b", 'Failed to handle leading/trailing whitespace in the input string.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(encode_cyclic))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
