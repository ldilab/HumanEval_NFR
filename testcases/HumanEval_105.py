# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The arr list contains integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
### The sorted, reversed, and replaced array is ["Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"]
assert by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]) == ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"], 'Failed to sort, reverse, and replace the array elements.'

### The arr list contains strange numbers (-1 and 55)
### The sorted, reversed, and replaced array is ["One"]
assert by_length([1, -1, 55]) == ["One"], 'Failed to handle case where the arr list contains strange numbers.'

## Edge Cases
### The arr list contains only integers less than 1 or greater than 9, so the function should return an empty list
assert by_length([10, 0, -5, 100, -100]) == [], 'Failed to handle case where no integers between 1 and 9 are present in the arr list.'

### The arr list is empty, so the function should return an empty list
assert by_length([]) == [], 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The arr list contains only integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive), but they are not sorted
### The sorted, reversed, and replaced array is ["Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"]
assert by_length([4, 2, 9, 1, 3, 8, 7, 6, 5]) == ["Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"], 'Failed to sort, reverse, and replace the array elements when the array is not sorted.'

### The arr list contains only integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive), but they are all the same
assert by_length([2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) == ["Two", "Two", "Two", "Two", "Two"], 'Failed to handle case where all elements in the arr list are the same.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The arr list contains 10^6 elements with random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
assert by_length([9] * 10**6) == ["Nine"] * 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The arr list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 10^6
### Since 10^6 is not between 1 and 9 (inclusive), the resulting array should be empty
assert by_length(list(range(10**6))) == ["Nine", "Eight", "Seven", "Six", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One"], 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The arr input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not by_length('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input arr is not a list.'

#### The arr list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not by_length([1, 2, 'invalid', 4]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(by_length))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
