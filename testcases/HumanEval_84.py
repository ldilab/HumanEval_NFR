# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The sum of the digits for N = 1000 is 1, so the function should return "1"
assert solve(1000) == "1", 'Failed to calculate the sum of digits in binary.'

### The sum of the digits for N = 150 is 6, so the function should return "110"
assert solve(150) == "110", 'Failed to calculate the sum of digits in binary.'

### The sum of the digits for N = 147 is 12, so the function should return "1100"
assert solve(147) == "1100", 'Failed to calculate the sum of digits in binary.'

## Edge Cases
### The sum of the digits in binary for N = 0 is 0, so the function should return "0"
assert solve(0) == "0", 'Failed to handle the case where N is 0.'

### The sum of the digits in binary for N = 1 is 1, so the function should return "1"
assert solve(1) == "1", 'Failed to handle the case where N is 1.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input value of N is the maximum value allowed, 10000
### The sum of the digits for N = 10000 is 1, so the function should return "1"
assert solve(10000) == "1", 'Failed to handle the maximum input value.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not solve('invalid'), 'Failed to handle the case where the input is not an integer.'

#### The input is a negative number, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not solve(-10), 'Failed to handle the case where the input is a negative number.'

#### The input value of N is larger than the allowed maximum value, 10000
#### The function should return an empty list
assert not solve(10001), 'Failed to handle the case where N exceeds the maximum allowed value.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(solve))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
