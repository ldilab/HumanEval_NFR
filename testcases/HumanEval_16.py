# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The string consists of 3 distinct characters: 'x', 'y', and 'z'
assert count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ') == 3, 'Failed to count distinct characters correctly.'

### The string consists of 4 distinct characters: 'J', 'e', 'r', and 'y'
assert count_distinct_characters('Jerry') == 4, 'Failed to count distinct characters correctly.'

## Edge Cases
### The input string is empty, so the function should return 0
assert count_distinct_characters('') == 0, 'Failed to handle an empty string.'

### The input string consists of only whitespace characters, so the function should return 1
assert count_distinct_characters('   ') == 1, 'Failed to handle a string consisting of only whitespace characters.'

### The input string has no distinct characters, so the function should return 1
assert count_distinct_characters('aaaaaa') == 1, 'Failed to handle a string with no distinct characters.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input string has a length of 10^6 and consists of a repeating pattern of 'abcde'
### The function should return 5, as there are 5 distinct characters in the string
assert count_distinct_characters('abcde' * (10**6 // 5)) == 5, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input string has a length of 10^6 and consists of the same character 'a'
### The function should return 1, as there is only one distinct character in the string
assert count_distinct_characters('a' * 10**6) == 1, 'Failed to handle case where all characters are the same.'

### The input string has a length of 10^6 and consists of distinct characters from 'a' to 'z' in alphabetical order
### The function should return 26, as there are 26 distinct characters in the string
assert count_distinct_characters(''.join(chr(97 + i) for i in range(26)) * (10**6 // 26)) == 26, 'Failed to handle case where all characters are distinct.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not a string, so the function should return 0
assert not count_distinct_characters(123), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a string.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(count_distinct_characters))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
