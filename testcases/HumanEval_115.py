# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The grid has 3 rows and 4 columns
### Each bucket has a capacity of 1
### The wells contain a total of 6 units of water
### The function should return 6, as it takes 6 lowerings to empty all the wells
assert max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1) == 6, 'Failed to calculate the number of times the buckets need to be lowered.'

### The grid has 4 rows and 4 columns
### Each bucket has a capacity of 2
### The wells contain a total of 10 units of water
### The function should return 5, as it takes 5 lowerings to empty all the wells
assert max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2) == 5, 'Failed to calculate the number of times the buckets need to be lowered.'

## Edge Cases
### The wells contain a total of 0 units of water
### The function should return 0, as there is no water to extract from the wells
assert max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where all wells are already empty.'

### The grid has 1 row and 1 column
### The bucket capacity is 10, which is greater than the total number of units of water in the grid (1)
### The function should return 1, as it takes 1 lowering to empty the well
assert max_fill([[1]], 10) == 1, 'Failed to handle case where the bucket capacity is greater than the total number of units of water.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The grid has 10^3 rows and 2 * 10^3 columns
### Each bucket has a capacity of 1
### The wells contain a total of 10^6 units of water
### The function should return 10^6, as it takes 10^6 lowerings to empty all the wells
assert max_fill([[1, 0] * 10**3] * 10**3, 1) == 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The grid has 10^3 rows and 3 * 10^3 columns
### Each bucket has a capacity of 10
### Each well contains 2000 units of water
### The function should return 2 * 10^5, as it takes 2000 / 10 * 10^3 lowerings
assert max_fill([[1, 1, 0] * 10**3] * 10**3, 10) == 2 * 10 ** 5, 'Failed to handle large input size where all wells are empty.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The bucket capacity is a negative number, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], -1), 'Failed to handle case where the bucket capacity is a negative number.'

#### The grid input is not a list of lists, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not max_fill('invalid', 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input grid is not a list of lists.'

#### The capacity input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input capacity is not an integer.'

#### The grid list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], ['invalid',1,1,1]], 1), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(max_fill))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
