# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The number 1 appears in multiple rows and columns
assert get_row([[1,2,3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,1,6],[1,2,3,4,5,1]], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)], 'Failed to find the correct coordinates for the number 1.'

### The number 3 appears in a single row and column
assert get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, -3]], -3) == [(2, 2)], 'Failed to find the correct coordinates for the number 3.'

### The function should return the coordinates sorted by row index in ascending order
assert get_row([[1], [], [1, 1]], 1) == [(0, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0)], 'Failed to find the correct coordinates for the number 1.'

### The function should return the coordinates sorted by row index in ascending order
### Within each row, the coordinates should be sorted by column index in descending order
assert get_row([[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1]], 1) == [(0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)], 'Failed to handle the case where the number appears in multiple rows and columns.'

## Edge Cases
### The list is empty, so the function should return an empty list
assert get_row([], 10) == [], 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The number 10 does not appear in any row, so the function should return an empty list
assert get_row([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 10) == [], 'Failed to handle the case where the number does not appear in any row.'

### The number 5 does not appear in any row, so the function should return an empty list
assert get_row([[1], [2], [3]], 5) == [], 'Failed to handle the case where the number does not appear in any row.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The lst list contains 10^3 rows, each with 10^3 columns
### The number 1 appears in all rows and columns
### The function should return all coordinates in descending order of column index within each row
assert get_row([[1]*10**3 for _ in range(10**3)], 1) == [(i, j) for i in range(10**3) for j in range(10**3-1, -1, -1)], 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The lst list contains 10^3 rows, each with 10^3 columns
### The number 10^9 does not appear in any row, so the function should return an empty list
assert get_row([[1]*10**3 for _ in range(10**3)], 10**9) == [], 'Failed to handle case where the number does not appear in any row.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The lst input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not get_row('invalid', 10), 'Failed to handle case where the input lst is not a list.'

#### The x input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not get_row([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input x is not an integer.'

#### The lst list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not get_row([[1, 2, 3], [4, 'invalid', 6]], 6), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

#### The lst list contains items that are not lists, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not get_row([[1, 2, 3], 'invalid'], 10), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not lists.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(get_row))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
