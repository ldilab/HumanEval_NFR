# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The input list is [1, 2, 3].
### The elements at index 0 (1) and index 3 (3) should be squared, resulting in [1, 2, 3].
### The sum of all elements in the list is 6.
assert sum_squares([1, 2, 3]) == 6, 'Failed to compute the correct sum for the given list.'

### The input list is empty, so the sum should be 0.
assert sum_squares([]) == 0, 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The input list is [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5].
### The elements at index 0 (-1), index 3 (-1) should be squared, resulting in [1, -5, 2, 1, -5].
### The elements at index 4 (-5) should be cubed, resulting in [1, -5, 2, 1, -125].
### The sum of all elements in the list is -126.
assert sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]) == -126, 'Failed to compute the correct sum for the given list.'

## Edge Cases
### The input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error.
assert not sum_squares('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a list.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
assert sum_squares([1] * 10**6) == 1 * 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1.
### The elements at index 3, 6, 9, 12, ... should be squared, resulting in a list of 10^6 elements, all of which are 1.
### The sum of all elements in the list is 10^6.
assert sum_squares([1] * 10**6) == 10**6, 'Failed to handle case where the subarray length is 1.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1.
### The elements at index 4, 8, 12, 16, ... should be cubed, resulting in a list of 10^6 elements, all of which are 1.
### The sum of all elements in the list is 10^6.
assert sum_squares([1] * 10**6) == 10**6, 'Failed to handle case where the subarray length is 2.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error.
assert not sum_squares('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a list.'

### The input list contains non-integer elements, so the function should handle the case not to raise error.
assert not sum_squares([1, 'invalid', 3, 'invalid', 5, 'invalid', 2]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains non-integer elements.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(sum_squares))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
