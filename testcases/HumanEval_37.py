# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The even indices of the input list are [2, 4, 6]
### After sorting them in ascending order, they become [1, 3, 5]
### The resulting list should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
assert sort_even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'Failed to sort even indices of the input list.'

### The even indices of the input list are [0, 2]
### After sorting them in ascending order, they become [3, 5]
### The resulting list should be [3, 6, 5, 4]
assert sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]) == [3, 6, 5, 4], 'Failed to sort even indices of the input list.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should return an empty list
assert sort_even([]) == [], 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The input list has a single element, so the function should return the same list
assert sort_even([1]) == [1], 'Failed to handle an input list with a single element.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1
assert sort_even([1] * 10**6) == [1] * 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are integers from 1 to 10^6
assert sort_even(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) == list(range(1, 10**6 + 1)), 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not sort_even('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a list.'

#### The input list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not sort_even([1, 2, 'invalid', 4]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(sort_even))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
