# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### There are 3 cars in each set, so there are 9 possible collisions
assert car_race_collision(3) == 9, 'Failed to count the correct number of collisions.'

### There are 5 cars in each set, so there are 25 possible collisions
assert car_race_collision(5) == 25, 'Failed to count the correct number of collisions.'

## Edge Cases
### There are no cars in each set, so there are no collisions
assert car_race_collision(0) == 0, 'Failed to handle the case where there are no cars.'

### There is only one car in each set, so there are 1 possible collisions
assert car_race_collision(1) == 1, 'Failed to handle the case where there is only one car.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The number of cars is 10^5, so there are 10^10 possible collisions
assert car_race_collision(10**5) == 10**10, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not an integer, so the function should return 0
assert not car_race_collision('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not an integer.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(car_race_collision))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
