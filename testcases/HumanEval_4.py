# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The mean absolute deviation of [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is 1.0
assert mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]) == 1.0, 'Failed to calculate mean absolute deviation correctly.'

### The mean absolute deviation of [2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0] is 0.0
### All elements are the same, so the absolute difference from the mean is 0 for each element
### The average of these differences is also 0
assert mean_absolute_deviation([2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]) == 0.0, 'Failed to handle case where all elements are the same.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not mean_absolute_deviation([]), 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The input list contains only one element, so the mean absolute deviation should be 0
assert mean_absolute_deviation([5.0]) == 0.0, 'Failed to handle a single-element input list.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1.0
### The mean absolute deviation should be 0.0 since all elements are the same
assert mean_absolute_deviation([1.0] * 10**6) == 0.0, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are consecutive integers from 1 to 10^6
### The mean absolute deviation should be approximately 250000.0
assert abs(mean_absolute_deviation(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) - 250000) < 0.001, 'Failed to calculate mean absolute deviation accurately for large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The numbers input is not a list of floats, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not mean_absolute_deviation('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input numbers is not a list of floats.'

#### The numbers list contains elements that are not floats, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 'invalid', 4.0]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not floats.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(mean_absolute_deviation))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
