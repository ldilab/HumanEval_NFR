# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The list [1, 2] is unbalanced and the sum of its elements is less than the maximum weight
### The function should return False
assert will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) == False, 'Failed to handle case where the list is unbalanced.'

### The list [3, 2, 3] is balanced, but the sum of its elements is more than the maximum weight
### The function should return False
assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) == False, 'Failed to handle case where the sum of elements is more than the maximum weight.'

### The list [3, 2, 3] is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than the maximum weight
### The function should return True
assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) == True, 'Failed to handle case where the list is balanced and the sum of elements is less than the maximum weight.'

### The list [3] is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than the maximum weight
### The function should return True
assert will_it_fly([3], 5) == True, 'Failed to handle case where the list has only one element.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty
assert will_it_fly([], 5) == True, 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The input list is length 1
assert will_it_fly([5], 6) == True, 'Failed to handle a length-1 input list.'

### The input list is length 1
assert will_it_fly([5], 4) == False, 'Failed to handle a length-1 input list.'

### The sum of the elements in the list is equal to the maximum weight, so the function should return True
assert will_it_fly([2, 2, 2], 6) == True, 'Failed to handle case where the sum of elements is equal to the maximum weight.'

### The maximum weight is a negative number, so the function should return False
assert will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], -10) == False, 'Failed to handle case where the maximum weight is negative.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The list contains 10^6 elements with all elements being 1
### The list is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than the maximum weight
### The function should return True
assert will_it_fly([1] * 10**6, 10**6) == True, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The list is unbalanced
### The function should return False
assert will_it_fly(([1] * 10**5) + [2] + ([1] * (10**5-1)), 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The maximum weight is less than the sum of the elements in the list
### The function should return False
assert will_it_fly([1] * 10**6, 10**5) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The q input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not will_it_fly('invalid', 10), 'Failed to handle case where the input q is not a list.'

#### The w input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not will_it_fly([1, 2, 3], 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input w is not an integer.'

#### The q list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not will_it_fly([1, 2, 'invalid', 4], 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(will_it_fly))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
