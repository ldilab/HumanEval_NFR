# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The sum of digits for -1 is -1, for -11 is -2, for 1 is 1, for -12 is -3, and for 11 is 2
### The sorted list based on the sum of digits is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
assert order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11], 'Failed to sort the list based on the sum of digits.'

### The input list is empty, so the function should return an empty list
assert order_by_points([]) == [], 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

## Edge Cases
### The sum of digits for 1 is 1, for 2 is 2, for 3 is 3, for 4 is 4, for 5 is 5, for 6 is 6, for 7 is 7, for 8 is 8, and for 9 is 9
### The sorted list based on the sum of digits is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
assert order_by_points([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'Failed to sort the list based on the sum of digits when all elements are positive integers.'

### The sum of digits for -1 is -1, for -2 is -2, for -3 is -3, for -4 is -4, for -5 is -5, for -6 is -6, for -7 is -7, for -8 is -8, and for -9 is -9
### The sorted list based on the sum of digits is [-9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1]
assert order_by_points([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]) == [-9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1], 'Failed to sort the list based on the sum of digits when all elements are negative integers.'

### The sum of digits for 0 is 0, for 1 is 1, for -1 is -1, for 2 is 2, for -2 is -2, for 3 is 3, for -3 is -3, for 4 is 4, and for -4 is -4
### The sorted list based on the sum of digits is [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
assert order_by_points([0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4]) == [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'Failed when the input list contains 0.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
assert order_by_points(list([1] * 100000)) == list([1] * 100000), 'Failed to handle a large input list.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
### The input list contains non-integer elements, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not order_by_points([1, 'invalid', 3]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains non-integer elements.'

#### The nums input is not a list, so the function should return an empty list
assert not order_by_points('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input nums is not a list.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(order_by_points))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
