# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The strings have the same characters, regardless of the order
assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc') == True, 'Failed to check if two strings have the same characters.'

### The strings have the same characters, regardless of the order
assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc') == True, 'Failed to check if two strings have the same characters.'

### The strings have the same characters, regardless of the order
assert same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd') == True, 'Failed to check if two strings have the same characters.'

### The strings have different characters
assert same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc') == False, 'Failed to check if two strings have different characters.'

### The strings have different characters
assert same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce') == False, 'Failed to check if two strings have different characters.'

### The strings have different characters
assert same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc') == False, 'Failed to check if two strings have different characters.'

## Edge Cases
### The input strings are empty, so the function should return True
assert same_chars('', '') == True, 'Failed to handle empty strings as input.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The strings contain 10^6 characters, which are all the same
### The function should return True, as the strings have the same characters
assert same_chars('a' * 10**6, 'a' * 10**6) == True, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The strings contain 10^6 characters, all of which are unique
### The function should return False, as the strings have different characters
assert same_chars('a' * 10**6, 'b' * 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The strings contain 10^6 characters, with different characters at the end
### The function should return False, as the strings have different characters
assert same_chars('a' * 10**6, 'a' * (10**6 - 1) + 'b') == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not same_chars('abcd', 123), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a string.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(same_chars))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
