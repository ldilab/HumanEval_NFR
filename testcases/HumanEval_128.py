# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The sum of magnitudes of integers is (1 + 2 + 2 + 4) = 9
### The product of all signs is (-1 * 1 * 1 * -1) = -1
### The expected result is 9 * -1 = -9
assert prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9, 'Failed to calculate the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of signs.'

### The sum of magnitudes of integers is (0 + 1) = 1
### The product of all signs is (0 * 1) = 0
### The expected result is 1 * 0 = 0
assert prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0, 'Failed to handle case with zero in the input list.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not prod_signs([]), 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1
### The sum of magnitudes of integers is 10^6
### The product of all signs is 1
### The expected result is 10^6 * 1 = 10^6
assert prod_signs([1] * 10**6) == 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are -1
### The sum of magnitudes of integers is 10^6
### The product of all signs is (-1)^(10^6) = +1
### The expected result is 10^6 * 1 = 10^6
assert prod_signs([-1] * 10**6) == 10**6, 'Failed to handle case where all elements have the same value.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 0
### The sum of magnitudes of integers is 0
### The product of all signs is 0
### The expected result is 0 * 0 = 0
assert prod_signs([0] * 10**6) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where all elements are zero.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The arr input is not a list of integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not prod_signs('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input arr is not a list of integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(prod_signs))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
