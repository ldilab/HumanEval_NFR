# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic is 4
assert smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4, 'Failed to find the minimum number of changes for a non-palindromic array.'

### The minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic is 1
assert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1, 'Failed to find the minimum number of changes for a non-palindromic array.'

### The array is already palindromic, so the minimum number of changes is 0
assert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0, 'Failed to handle the case where the array is already palindromic.'

## Edge Cases
### The array is empty, so the minimum number of changes is 0
assert smallest_change([]) == 0, 'Failed to handle an empty array.'

### The array is length 1, so the minimum number of changes is 0
assert smallest_change([8]) == 0, 'Failed to handle a length-1 array.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The array contains 10^6 elements with increasing values from 1 to 10^6
assert smallest_change(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) == 5 * 10**5, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The array contains 10^6 elements with the same value
assert smallest_change([0] * 10**6) == 0, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The arr input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not smallest_change('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input arr is not a list.'

#### The arr input contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not smallest_change([1, 2, 'invalid', 4]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(smallest_change))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
