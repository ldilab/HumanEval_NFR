# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The opening bracket is not closed, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing("<") == False, 'Failed to handle case with a single opening bracket.'

### The opening and closing brackets are balanced, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("<>") == True, 'Failed to handle case with a single opening and closing bracket.'

### All opening and closing brackets are balanced, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("<<><>>") == True, 'Failed to handle case with multiple opening and closing brackets.'

### The opening bracket is not closed, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing("><<>") == False, 'Failed to handle case with unbalanced brackets.'

## Edge Cases
### The input string is empty, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("") == True, 'Failed to handle an empty input string.'

### There are no opening brackets, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing(">>") == False, 'Failed to handle case with no opening brackets.'

### There are no closing brackets, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing("<<") == False, 'Failed to handle case with no closing brackets.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input string contains 10^6 opening brackets followed by 10^6 closing brackets
### All brackets are balanced, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("<" * 10**6 + ">" * 10**6) == True, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input string contains 10^6 opening brackets followed by 10^6 closing brackets
### The opening brackets are not closed, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing("<" * 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle case with unbalanced brackets.'

### The input string contains 10^6 closing brackets followed by 10^6 opening brackets
### The closing brackets have no corresponding opening brackets, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing(">" * 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle case with unbalanced brackets.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input brackets is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not correct_bracketing(123), 'Failed to handle case where the input brackets is not a string.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(correct_bracketing))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
