# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### There are no three distinct elements that sum to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where no triple sums to zero.'

### The triple [1, 3, -2] sums to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == True, 'Failed to find a triple that sums to zero.'

### There are no three distinct elements that sum to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where no triple sums to zero.'

### The triple [2, 4, -6] sums to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) == True, 'Failed to find a triple that sums to zero.'

### There are less than three elements in the list, so no triple can sum to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where the list has less than three elements.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so no triple can sum to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([]) == False, 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### There are no three distinct elements in the list, so no triple can sum to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([0, 0, 0, 0]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where there are no distinct elements in the list.'

### There are multiple triples that sum to zero
assert triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, -3, -2, 3]) == True, 'Failed to handle case where there are multiple triples that sum to zero.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input list contains 10^3 elements, all of which are 0
### There are no three distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function should return False
assert triples_sum_to_zero([0] * 10**3) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input list is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not triples_sum_to_zero('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a list.'

#### The input list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 'invalid', 4]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(triples_sum_to_zero))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
