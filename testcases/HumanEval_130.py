# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The first 3 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence are [1, 3, 2]
assert tri(2) == [1, 3, 2], 'Failed to generate the first 3 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.'

### The first 4 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence are [1, 3, 2, 8]
assert tri(3) == [1, 3, 2, 8], 'Failed to generate the first 4 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.'

### The first 5 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence are [1, 3, 2, 8, 3]
assert tri(4) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 3], 'Failed to generate the first 5 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.'

## Edge Cases
### The input n is 0, so the function should return [1]
assert tri(0) == [1], 'Failed to handle the case where n is 0.'

### The input n is 1, so the function should return [1, 3]
assert tri(1) == [1, 3], 'Failed to handle the case where n is 1.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input n is 10^6, generating the first 10^6 + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence
### The function should execute efficiently and provide the result within 5 seconds
assert len(tri(10**6)) == 10**6 + 1, 'Failed to execute within 5 seconds for a large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input n is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not tri('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input n is not an integer.'

#### The input n is a negative number, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not tri(-5), 'Failed to handle case where the input n is a negative number.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(tri))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
