# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The length of the string "Hello" is 5, which is a prime number
assert prime_length('Hello') == True, 'Failed to handle case where the string length is a prime number.'

### The length of the string "abcdcba" is 7, which is a prime number
assert prime_length('abcdcba') == True, 'Failed to handle case where the string length is a prime number.'

### The length of the string "kittens" is 7, which is a prime number
assert prime_length('kittens') == True, 'Failed to handle case where the string length is a prime number.'

### The length of the string "orange" is 6, which is not a prime number
assert prime_length('orange') == False, 'Failed to handle case where the string length is not a prime number.'

## Edge Cases
### The input string is empty, so the function should return False
assert prime_length('') == False, 'Failed to handle an empty string.'

### The length of the string "a" is 1, which is not a prime number
assert prime_length('a') == False, 'Failed to handle a string of length 1.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input string is a very long string consisting of the letter "a" repeated 10^6 times
### The length of the string is 10^6, which is not a prime number
assert prime_length('a' * 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not a string, handle the case not to raise error to indicate the input is wrong
assert not prime_length(123), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a string.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(prime_length))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
