# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The word "string" has the maximum number of unique characters
assert find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string", 'Failed to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters.'

### The word "enam" has the maximum number of unique characters
assert find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam", 'Failed to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters.'

### The word "aaaaaaa" has the maximum number of unique characters
assert find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == "aaaaaaa", 'Failed to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters.'

### The word "python" has the maximum number of unique characters
assert find_max(["hello", "world", "python"]) == "python", 'Failed to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters.'

### The word "programming" has the maximum number of unique characters
assert find_max(["code", "developer", "programming"]) == "programming", 'Failed to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should return an empty string
assert find_max([]) == '', 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### All words in the input list are empty strings, so the function should return an empty string
assert find_max(['', '', '']) == '', 'Failed to handle case where all words in the input list are empty strings.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The words list contains 10^6 words, each with 10 characters
### Each word has the same number of unique characters, so the function should return the first word in lexicographical order
assert find_max(['a'*10]*10**6) == 'a'*10, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The words list contains 10^6 words, each with 10 characters
### Each word has the same number of unique characters, so the function should return the first word in lexicographical order
assert find_max(['a'*10]*10**6 + ['b'*10]*10**6) == 'a'*10, 'Failed to handle case where multiple words have the maximum number of unique characters.'

### The words list contains 10^6 words, each with 10 characters
### Each word has a different number of unique characters, so the function should return the word with the maximum number of unique characters
assert find_max(['a'*i for i in range(1, 10**6 + 1)]) == 'a'*10**6, 'Failed to handle case where each word has a different number of unique characters.'

### The words list contains 10^6 words, each with 10 characters
### Each word is a random string, so there is no word with the maximum number of unique characters
### The function should return the first word in lexicographical order
import random
import string
words = [''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase, k=10)) for _ in range(10**6)]
assert find_max(words) == min(words), 'Failed to handle case where no word has the maximum number of unique characters.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
### Capital letters are not allowed, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not find_max(['Hello', 'World']), 'Failed to handle case where capital letters are not allowed.'

#### The words input is not a list of strings, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not find_max('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input words is not a list of strings.'

#### The words list contains elements that are not strings, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not find_max(['hello', 123, 'world']), 'Failed to handle case where the input words list contains elements that are not strings.'

#### Special characters are not allowed, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not find_max(['hello', 'world', 'python!']), 'Failed to handle case where special characters are not allowed.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(find_max))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
