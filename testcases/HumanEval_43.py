# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### There are no distinct elements in the list that sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where no distinct elements sum to zero.'

### There are no distinct elements in the list that sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where no distinct elements sum to zero.'

### There are no distinct elements in the list that sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where no distinct elements sum to zero.'

### The distinct elements -5 and 5 sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]) == True, 'Failed to find a pair of distinct elements that sum to zero.'

### There is only one element in the list, so no pair can sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where there is only one element in the list.'

## Edge Cases
### The list is empty, so no pair can sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([]) == False, 'Failed to handle an empty list input.'

### The list contains two zeros, so they sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([0, 0]) == True, 'Failed to handle case where the list contains two zeros.'

### The list contains two identical non-zero elements, so no pair can sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 1]) == False, 'Failed to handle case where the list contains two identical non-zero elements.'

### The list contains two distinct elements that sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([-2, 2]) == True, 'Failed to handle case where the list contains two distinct elements that sum to zero.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The list contains 10^4 elements with increasing values from 1 to 10^4
### There is no pair of distinct elements that sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero(list(range(1, 10**4 + 1))) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The list contains 10^4 elements, all of which are zeros
### There is at least one pair of distinct elements that sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([0] * 10**4) == True, 'Failed to handle case where all elements in the list are zero.'

### The list contains 10^4 elements, all of which are 1
### There is no pair of distinct elements that sum to zero
assert pairs_sum_to_zero([1] * 10**4) == False, 'Failed to handle case where all elements in the list are the same non-zero value.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input l is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not pairs_sum_to_zero('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input l is not a list.'

#### The input l contains non-integer elements, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 'invalid', 2]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains non-integer elements.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(pairs_sum_to_zero))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
