# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### For n = 3, the pile of stones will have 3 levels with 3, 5, and 7 stones, respectively.
assert make_a_pile(3) == [3, 5, 7], 'Failed for general case where n is odd.'

### For n = 4, the pile of stones will have 4 levels with 4, 6, 8, and 10 stones, respectively.
assert make_a_pile(4) == [4, 6, 8, 10], 'Failed for general case where n is even.'

#### For n = 7, the pile of stones will have 7 levels with 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 stones, respectively.
assert make_a_pile(7) == [7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19], 'Failed for general case where n is odd.'

## Edge Cases
### For n = 1, the pile of stones will have 1 level of 1 stone
assert make_a_pile(1) == [1], 'Failed for the case where n = 1.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The value of n is 10^5, so the pile will have 10^5 levels.
assert make_a_pile(10**5) == [10**5 + 2*i for i in range(10**5)], 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input n is not a positive integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not make_a_pile(0), 'Failed to handle edge case where n is 0.'

#### The input n is not a positive integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not make_a_pile(-10), 'Failed to handle case where the input n is negative.'

#### The input n is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not make_a_pile('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input n is not an integer.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(make_a_pile))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
