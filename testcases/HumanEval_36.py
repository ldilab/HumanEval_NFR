# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### There are no numbers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7
### Therefore, the function should return 0
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where there are no numbers that satisfy the condition.'

### The numbers less than 78 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7 are: 77, 77
### Therefore, the function should return 2
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2, 'Failed to correctly count the number of times the digit 7 appears.'

### The numbers less than 79 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7 are: 77, 77, 77
### Therefore, the function should return 3
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3, 'Failed to correctly count the number of times the digit 7 appears.'

## Edge Cases
### The input `n` is less than or equal to 10, so the function should return 0
assert fizz_buzz(10) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where `n` is less than or equal to 10.'

### There are no numbers less than 11 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7
### Therefore, the function should return 0
assert fizz_buzz(11) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where there are no numbers that satisfy the condition.'

### There are no numbers less than 12 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7
### Therefore, the function should return 0
assert fizz_buzz(12) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where there are no numbers that satisfy the condition.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input `n` is a large number, so the function should return the result within 5 seconds
assert fizz_buzz(10**7) == 1125880, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input `n` is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not fizz_buzz('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input `n` is not an integer.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(fizz_buzz))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
