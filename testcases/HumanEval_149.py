# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The input list has 3 strings, and only "aa" has an even length
### The function should delete the strings with odd lengths and return the sorted list ["aa"]
assert sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) == ["aa"], 'Failed to delete strings with odd lengths and sort the list.'

### The input list has 4 strings, and "ab" and "cd" have even lengths
### The function should delete the strings with odd lengths and return the sorted list ["ab", "cd"]
assert sorted_list_sum(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) == ["ab", "cd"], 'Failed to delete strings with odd lengths and sort the list.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should return an empty list
assert sorted_list_sum([]) == [], 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### All strings in the input list have odd lengths, so the function should return an empty list
assert sorted_list_sum(["a", "b", "c"]) == [], 'Failed to handle case where all strings have odd lengths.'

### All strings in the input list have the same length, so the function should return the list sorted alphabetically
assert sorted_list_sum(["cc", "bb", "aa"]) == ["aa", "bb", "cc"], 'Failed to handle case where all strings have the same length.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input list contains 10^6 strings, all with even lengths
### The function should delete the strings with odd lengths and return the sorted list
assert sorted_list_sum(["a" * (i % 2) for i in range(10**6)]) == ["a" * (i % 2) for i in range(0, 10**6, 2)], 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input list contains 10^6 strings, all with the same length and the same value
### The function should return the list sorted alphabetically
assert sorted_list_sum(["a" * 10**6] * 10**6) == ["a" * 10**6] * 10**6, 'Failed to handle case where all strings have the same length and the same value.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The lst input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not sorted_list_sum('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input lst is not a list.'

#### The lst list contains elements that are not strings, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not sorted_list_sum(['a', 1, 'b', 2]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not strings.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(sorted_list_sum))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
