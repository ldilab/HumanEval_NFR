# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The second smallest element in the list is 2
assert next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2, 'Failed to find the second smallest element.'

### The second smallest element in the list is 2
assert next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2, 'Failed to find the second smallest element.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not next_smallest([]), 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### There is no second smallest element in the list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not next_smallest([1, 1]), 'Failed to handle case where there is no second smallest element.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are the same value
### Since there is only one unique element, there is no second smallest element and the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not next_smallest([5] * 10**6), 'Failed to handle case where all elements in the list are the same value.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1
### Since there is only one unique element, there is no second smallest element and the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not next_smallest([1] * 10**6), 'Failed to handle case where all elements in the list are the same value.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements with increasing values from 1 to 10^6
### The second smallest element in the list is 2
assert next_smallest(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) == 2, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The lst input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not next_smallest('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input lst is not a list.'

#### The lst list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not next_smallest([1, 2, 'invalid', 4]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(next_smallest))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
