# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The second word "abd" is not a substring of the first word "abcd"
assert cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") == False, 'Failed to handle case where the second word is not a substring.'

### The second word "ell" is a substring of the first word "hello"
assert cycpattern_check("hello","ell") == True, 'Failed to handle case where the second word is a substring.'

### None of the rotations of the second word "psus" are substrings of the first word "whassup"
assert cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") == False, 'Failed to handle case where none of the rotations of the second word are substrings.'

### One of the rotations of the second word "baa" is a substring of the first word "abab"
assert cycpattern_check("abab","baa") == True, 'Failed to handle case where one of the rotations of the second word is a substring.'

### None of the rotations of the second word "eeff" are substrings of the first word "efef"
assert cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") == False, 'Failed to handle case where none of the rotations of the second word are substrings.'

### One of the rotations of the second word "simen" is a substring of the first word "himenss"
assert cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") == True, 'Failed to handle case where one of the rotations of the second word is a substring.'

## Edge Cases
### The first word is an empty string, so the function should return False
assert cycpattern_check("", "abc") == False, 'Failed to handle case where the first word is an empty string.'

### The second word is an empty string, so the function should return False
assert cycpattern_check("abc", "") == False, 'Failed to handle case where the second word is an empty string.'

### Both words are empty strings, so the function should return False
assert cycpattern_check("", "") == False, 'Failed to handle case where both words are empty strings.'

### The second word is longer than the first word, so the function should return False
assert cycpattern_check("abc", "abcd") == False, 'Failed to handle case where the second word is longer than the first word.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The first word contains 10^6 characters and the second word is a rotation of the first word
### The function should return True
assert cycpattern_check("a" * 10**6, "a" * 10**6) == True, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The first word contains 10^6 characters and the second word is not a substring of the first word
### The function should return False
assert cycpattern_check("a" * 10**6, "b" * 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The inputs are not strings, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not cycpattern_check(123, [1, 2, 3]), 'Failed to handle case where the inputs are not strings.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(cycpattern_check))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
