# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The side length is 5 and the height is 3, so the area of the triangle is 7.5
assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5, 'Failed to calculate the area of the triangle.'

### The side length is 2 and the height is 6, so the area of the triangle is 6.0
assert triangle_area(2, 6) == 6.0, 'Failed to calculate the area of the triangle.'

### The side length is 10 and the height is 1, so the area of the triangle is 5.0
assert triangle_area(10, 1) == 5.0, 'Failed to calculate the area of the triangle.'

## Edge Cases
### The side length is a non-integer value, so the function should return 8.25
assert triangle_area(5.5, 3) == 8.25, 'Failed to handle a float side length.'

### The height is a non-integer value, so the function should return 8.25
assert triangle_area(5, 3.3) == 8.25, 'Failed to handle a float height.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### Satisfied if no performance-related issues occur across all test cases

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
## The side length is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not triangle_area(-5, 3), 'Failed to handle a negative side length.'

## The height is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not triangle_area(5, -3), 'Failed to handle a negative height.'

#### The side length is not a numeric value, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not triangle_area('invalid', 3), 'Failed to raise a TypeError for a non-numeric side length.'

#### The height is not a numeric value, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not triangle_area(5, 'invalid'), 'Failed to raise a TypeError for a non-numeric height.'


### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(triangle_area))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
