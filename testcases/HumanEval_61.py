# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The bracketing is correct, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("()") == True, 'Failed to handle correct bracketing.'

### The bracketing is correct, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("(()())") == True, 'Failed to handle correct bracketing.'

### The bracketing is not correct, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing(")(") == False, 'Failed to handle incorrect bracketing.'

## Edge Cases
### The bracketing is not correct, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing("(") == False, 'Failed to handle case with only an opening bracket.'

### The bracketing is correct, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("") == True, 'Failed to handle empty bracketing.'

### The bracketing is not correct, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing("())(") == False, 'Failed to handle case with unmatched opening and closing brackets.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The `brackets` string contains 10^6 opening brackets followed by 10^6 closing brackets
### The bracketing is correct, so the function should return True
assert correct_bracketing("(" * 10**6 + ")" * 10**6) == True, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The `brackets` string contains 10^6 opening brackets followed by 10^6 closing brackets in reverse order
### The bracketing is not correct, so the function should return False
assert correct_bracketing(")" * 10**6 + "(" * 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle large input size with incorrect bracketing.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The `brackets` input is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not correct_bracketing(['(', ')']), 'Failed to handle case where the input brackets is not a string.'

#### The `brackets` string contains characters other than '(' and ')', so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not correct_bracketing("(a)b(c)"), 'Failed to handle case where the input string contains non-bracket characters.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(correct_bracketing))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
