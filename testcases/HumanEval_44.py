# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The number 8 in base 3 is represented as '22'
assert change_base(8, 3) == '22', 'Failed to convert number to the desired base.'

### The number 8 in base 2 is represented as '1000'
assert change_base(8, 2) == '1000', 'Failed to convert number to the desired base.'

### The number 7 in base 2 is represented as '111'
assert change_base(7, 2) == '111', 'Failed to convert number to the desired base.'

## Edge Cases
### The input number is 0, so the function should return '0' in any base
assert change_base(0, 3) == '0', 'Failed to handle case where the input number is 0.'

### The input base is 1, which is not a valid base, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not change_base(8, 1), 'Failed to handle case where the base is not a valid base.'

### The input number is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not change_base(-8, 2), 'Failed to handle case where the input number is negative.'

### The input base is greater than 9, which is not a valid base, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not change_base(8, 10), 'Failed to handle case where the base is not a valid base.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input number is 10^6, and the base is 2
### The function should return a string representation of the number in base 2 within a reasonable time frame
assert change_base(10**6, 2) == '11110100001001000000', 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input number is 10^6, and the base is 9
### The function should return a string representation of the number in base 9 within a reasonable time frame
assert change_base(10**6, 9) == '1783661', 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input number is 10^18, and the base is 2
### The function should return a string representation of the number in base 2 within a reasonable time frame
assert change_base(10**18, 2) == '110111100000101101101011001110100111011001000000000000000000', 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input number is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not change_base('invalid', 2), 'Failed to handle case where the input number is not an integer.'

#### The input base is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not change_base(8, 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input base is not an integer.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(change_base))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
