# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The strings can be concatenated as '(())()', which is a good string
assert match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes', 'Failed to handle case where a good string can be formed.'

### The strings cannot be concatenated to form a good string, as there is an unbalanced closing parenthesis
assert match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No', 'Failed to handle case where no good string can be formed.'

## Edge Cases
### Both strings are empty, so they can be concatenated to form an empty string, which is considered a good string
assert match_parens(['', '']) == 'Yes', 'Failed to handle case where both strings are empty.'

### One of the strings is empty, so the other string can be concatenated as is, which is a good string
assert match_parens(['', '()']) == 'Yes', 'Failed to handle case where one of the strings is empty.'

### One of the strings is empty and the other contains unbalanced parentheses, so no good string can be formed
assert match_parens(['', '())']) == 'No', 'Failed to handle case where one string is empty and the other contains unbalanced parentheses.'

### The strings cannot be concatenated to form a good string
assert match_parens([')(', '()()']) == 'No', 'Failed to handle case where no good string can be formed.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The strings are very long, but can be concatenated to form a good string
assert match_parens(['(' * 10**5 + ')', '(' + ')' * 10**5]) == 'Yes', 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The strings are very long and cannot be concatenated to form a good string
assert match_parens(['(' * 10**5 + ')', ')' * 10**5]) == 'No', 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The lst input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not match_parens('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input lst is not a list.'

#### One of the items in lst is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not match_parens(['()', 123]), 'Failed to handle case where one of the strings in lst is not a string.'

### Both strings contain letter other than parentheses, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not match_parens(['abc', 'def']), 'Failed to handle case where strings contain letters other than parentheses.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(match_parens))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
