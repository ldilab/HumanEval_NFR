# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The sum of numbers from 1 to 30 is 465
assert sum_to_n(30) == 465, 'Failed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.'

### The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050
assert sum_to_n(100) == 5050, 'Failed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.'

### The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 15
assert sum_to_n(5) == 15, 'Failed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.'

### The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is 55
assert sum_to_n(10) == 55, 'Failed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.'

### The sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is 1
assert sum_to_n(1) == 1, 'Failed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.'

## Edge Cases
### n is negative, so the function should return 0
assert sum_to_n(-5) == 0, 'Failed to handle negative n.'

### n is 0, so the function should return 0
assert sum_to_n(0) == 0, 'Failed to handle n being 0.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The function should provide results within 5 seconds even for extremely large inputs
### The sum of numbers from 1 to 10^6 is 500000500000
assert sum_to_n(10**6) == 500000500000, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The n input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not sum_to_n('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input n is not an integer.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(sum_to_n))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
