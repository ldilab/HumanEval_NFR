# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The odd numbers in the list are 1, 3, 0
### The sum of the squares of these numbers is 1^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 9 + 0 = 10
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10, 'Failed to calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers correctly.'

### There are no odd numbers in the list, so the sum should be 0
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where there are no odd numbers in the list.'

### The only odd number in the list is 9
### The square of 9 is 9^2 = 81
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81, 'Failed to calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers correctly.'

### The list contains one number, 0, which is not odd
### The sum of the squares of odd numbers is 0
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where the list contains only one number that is not odd.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should return 0
assert double_the_difference([]) == 0, 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The list contains all negative numbers, so the sum should be 0
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, -3]) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers in the list are negative.'

### The list contains all non-integer numbers, so the sum should be 0
assert double_the_difference([1.5, 2.5, 3.5]) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers in the list are non-integer.'

### The list contains combinations of negative numbers, non-integer numbers, and odd numbers
### The sum of the squares of the odd numbers is 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 = 35
assert double_the_difference([-1, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 5]) == 25, 'Failed to handle case where the list contains combinations of negative numbers, non-integer numbers, and odd numbers.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are odd numbers
### The sum of the squares of these numbers is 1^2 + 3^2 + ... + (10^6)^2 = 1 + 9 + ... + 10^12 = 166666666666500000
assert double_the_difference(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1, 2))) == 166666666666500000, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers in the list are odd.'

### The list contains 10^6 elements, half of which are odd numbers and the other half are even numbers
### The sum of the squares of the odd numbers is 1^2 + 3^2 + ... + (10^6 - 1)^2 = 1 + 9 + ... + 999,999,001 = 166,666,667,000,000,000
assert double_the_difference(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) == 166666666666500000, 'Failed to handle case where half of the numbers are odd and the other half are even.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The list contains non-numeric elements, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert double_the_difference([1, 2, 'invalid', 4]) == 1, 'Failed to handle case where the list contains non-numeric elements.'

#### The input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not double_the_difference('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not a list.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(double_the_difference))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
