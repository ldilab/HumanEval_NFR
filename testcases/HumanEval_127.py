# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The two intervals don't intersect, so the function should return "NO"
assert intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) == "NO", 'Failed to handle case where the intervals don\'t intersect.'

### The two intervals don't intersect, so the function should return "NO"
assert intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) == "NO", 'Failed to handle case where the intervals don\'t intersect.'

### The two intervals don't intersect, so the function should return "NO"
assert intersection((1, 2), (3, 4)) == "NO", 'Failed to handle case where the intervals don\'t intersect.'

### The intersection of the intervals (0, 3) and (2, 4) is (2, 3)
### The length of the intersection is 1, which is not a prime number
### Therefore, the function should return "NO"
assert intersection((0, 3), (2, 4)) == "NO", 'Failed to determine if the length of the intersection is a prime number.'

### The intersection of the intervals (0, 2) and (1, 3) is (1, 2)
### The length of the intersection is 1, which is not a prime number
### Therefore, the function should return "NO"
assert intersection((0, 2), (1, 3)) == "NO", 'Failed to determine if the length of the intersection is a prime number.'


## Edge Cases
### One interval is subsumed by another
### The intersection of the intervals (-3, -1) and (-5, 5) is (-3, -1)
### The length of the intersection is 3, which is a prime number
### Therefore, the function should return "YES"
assert intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) == "YES", 'Failed to determine if the length of the intersection is a prime number.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The length of the intersection is 2^31 - 1, which is a prime number
### Therefore, the function should return "YES"
assert intersection((-2**64, 2**32 - 1), (2**31, 2**64)) == "YES", 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The length of the intersection is 1, which is not a prime number
### Therefore, the function should return "NO"
assert intersection((-10**10, -1), (-10**10 + 1, -10**10 + 2)) == "NO", 'Failed to handle case where the length of the intersection is 1.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The interval1 tuple contains non-integer elements, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not intersection(('1', 2), (2, 3)), 'Failed to handle case where the input interval1 contains non-integer elements.'

#### The interval2 tuple contains non-integer elements, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not intersection((1, 2), (2, '3')), 'Failed to handle case where the input interval2 contains non-integer elements.'

#### The start value of interval1 is greater than the end value, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not intersection((3, 2), (2, 3)), 'Failed to handle case where the start value of interval1 is greater than the end value.'

#### The start value of interval2 is greater than the end value, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not intersection((1, 2), (3, 2)), 'Failed to handle case where the start value of interval2 is greater than the end value.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(intersection))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
