# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The input list contains three elements, with sum of digits 0, 2 and 0, respectively
### The function should return 1
assert count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1, 'Failed to count all elements with a sum of digits greater than 0.'

### The input list contains three elements, all of which have a sum of digits greater than 0
### The function should return 3
assert count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3, 'Failed to count all elements with a sum of digits greater than 0.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should return 0
assert count_nums([]) == 0, 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The input list contains one element, which has a sum of digits greater than 0
### The function should return 1
assert count_nums([1]) == 1, 'Failed to handle a single element in the input list.'

### The input list contains one element, which has a sum of digits equal to 0
### The function should return 0
assert count_nums([0]) == 0, 'Failed to handle a single element with a sum of digits equal to 0.'

### The input list contains one element, which is a negative number
assert count_nums([-123]) == 1, 'Failed to handle a single negative element in the input list.'

### The input list contains one element, which is a negative number
assert count_nums([-9000000001111111100000000000000]) == 0, 'Failed to handle a single negative element in the input list.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are positive numbers with a sum of digits greater than 0
### The function should return 10^6
assert count_nums(list(range(1, 10**6 + 1))) == 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The input list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 0
### The function should return 0
assert count_nums([0] * 10**6) == 0, 'Failed to handle case where all elements have a sum of digits equal to 0.'

### The input list contains 1001 elements, from -1000 to 0
### The function should return (8+7+...+1) + (100-(1+2))+(100-(1+2+3))+...+(100-(1+2+...+10)) = 717
assert count_nums(list(range(-1000, 1))) == 717, 'Failed to handle large input size with negative elements.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The arr input is not a list of integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not count_nums('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input arr is not a list of integers.'

#### The arr list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not count_nums([1, 2, 'invalid', 4]), 'Failed to handle case where the input list contains elements that are not integers.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(count_nums))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
