# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The decimal number 10 in binary is 1010
### The binary representation should have the 'db' prefix and suffix
assert decimal_to_binary(10) == "db1010db", 'Failed to convert decimal 10 to binary.'

### The decimal number 15 in binary is 1111
### The binary representation should have the 'db' prefix and suffix
assert decimal_to_binary(15) == "db1111db", 'Failed to convert decimal 15 to binary.'

### The decimal number 32 in binary is 100000
### The binary representation should have the 'db' prefix and suffix
assert decimal_to_binary(32) == "db100000db", 'Failed to convert decimal 32 to binary.'

## Edge Cases
### The decimal number 0 in binary is 0
### The binary representation should have the 'db' prefix and suffix
assert decimal_to_binary(0) == "db0db", 'Failed to handle decimal 0.'

### The decimal number 1 in binary is 1
### The binary representation should have the 'db' prefix and suffix
assert decimal_to_binary(1) == "db1db", 'Failed to handle decimal 1.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The decimal number 10^9 in binary has approximately 30 digits
### The binary representation should have the 'db' prefix and suffix
assert decimal_to_binary(10**9) == "db111011100110101100101000000000db", 'Failed to handle large input.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The decimal input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not decimal_to_binary('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input is not an integer.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(decimal_to_binary))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
