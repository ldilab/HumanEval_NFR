# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### All elements in `lst1` are already even, so no exchange is needed
assert exchange([2, 4, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == "YES", 'Failed to handle case where `lst1` is already a list of even numbers.'

### There are enough even numbers, so an exchange is possible
assert exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == "YES", 'Failed to handle case where `lst1` and `lst2` have the same elements.'

### Exchange of elements between `lst1` and `lst2` is not possible
assert exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) == "NO", 'Failed to handle case where an exchange is not possible.'

### Both `lst1` and `lst2` are lists of even numbers, so an exchange is possible
assert exchange([2, 4, 6, 8], [10, 12, 14, 16]) == "YES", 'Failed to handle case where both `lst1` and `lst2` are lists of even numbers.'

## Edge Cases
### `lst1` initially has odd numbers only, but it is possible to exchange them to even numbers
assert exchange([1, 3, 5], [8, 16, 32]) == "YES", 'Failed to handle case where both `lst1` and `lst2` are lists of even numbers.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The lengths of `lst1` and `lst2` are both 10^6
### All elements in `lst1` are even, so no exchange is needed
assert exchange([2] * 10**6, [1] * 10**6) == "YES", 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The lengths of `lst1` and `lst2` are both 10^6
### Exchange of elements between `lst1` and `lst2` is not possible
assert exchange([1] * 10**6, [1] * 10**6) == "NO", 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The lengths of `lst1` and `lst2` are both 10^6
### Exchange of elements between `lst1` and `lst2` is possible
assert exchange([1] * 10**6, [2] * 10**6) == "YES", 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input `lst1` is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not exchange('invalid', [1, 2, 3, 4]), 'Failed to handle case where the input `lst1` is not a list.'

#### The input `lst2` is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input `lst2` is not a list.'

#### `lst1` contains elements that are not numbers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not exchange([1, 2, 'invalid', 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]), 'Failed to handle case where `lst1` contains elements that are not numbers.'

#### `lst2` contains elements that are not numbers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 'invalid', 4]), 'Failed to handle case where `lst2` contains elements that are not numbers.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(exchange))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
