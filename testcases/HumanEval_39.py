# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The 1st prime Fibonacci number is 2
assert prime_fib(1) == 2, 'Failed to find the 1st prime Fibonacci number.'

### The 2nd prime Fibonacci number is 3
assert prime_fib(2) == 3, 'Failed to find the 2nd prime Fibonacci number.'

### The 3rd prime Fibonacci number is 5
assert prime_fib(3) == 5, 'Failed to find the 3rd prime Fibonacci number.'

### The 4th prime Fibonacci number is 13
assert prime_fib(4) == 13, 'Failed to find the 4th prime Fibonacci number.'

### The 5th prime Fibonacci number is 89
assert prime_fib(5) == 89, 'Failed to find the 5th prime Fibonacci number.'

## Edge Cases
### The input `n` is less than or equal to 0, so the function should return an error or raise an exception
### Since the specific behavior is not defined, we cannot assert an expected output

### The input `n` is larger than the maximum possible `n` that can be calculated within a reasonable time frame
### Since the specific behavior is not defined, we cannot assert an expected output

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input `n` is 10^2, which is a large input size
### The function should provide the result within 5 seconds
assert prime_fib(10**2) is not None, 'Failed to handle large input.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input `n` is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not prime_fib('invalid'), 'Failed to handle invalid input.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(prime_fib))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
