# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The sum of 2 and 3 is 5
assert add(2, 3) == 5, 'Failed to add two positive numbers.'

### The sum of 5 and 7 is 12
assert add(5, 7) == 12, 'Failed to add two positive numbers.'

## Edge Cases
### The sum of 0 and 0 is 0
assert add(0, 0) == 0, 'Failed to add zero and zero.'

### The sum of -5 and 3 is -2
assert add(-5, 3) == -2, 'Failed to add a negative and a positive number.'

### The sum of -10 and -7 is -17
assert add(-10, -7) == -17, 'Failed to add two negative numbers.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The function should execute within a reasonable time frame for any input size
### No specific test case is required to verify this requirement

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The x input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not add('invalid', 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input x is not an integer.'

#### The y input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not add(5, 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input y is not an integer.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(add))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
