# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### All numbers in the list are below the threshold
assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) == True, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers are below the threshold.'

### At least one number in the list is equal to or greater than the threshold
assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) == False, 'Failed to handle case where at least one number is equal to or greater than the threshold.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not below_threshold([], 10), 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### All numbers in the list are equal to the threshold, so the function should return False
assert below_threshold([10, 10, 10, 10], 10) == False, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers are equal to the threshold.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are below the threshold
assert below_threshold(list(range(10**6)), 10**9) == True, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

### The list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are equal to the threshold
assert below_threshold([10**9] * 10**6, 10**9) == False, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers are equal to the threshold.'

### The list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are above the threshold
assert below_threshold(list(range(10**6, 10**6 + 10**6)), 10**6) == False, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers are above the threshold.'

### The list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are negative
### The threshold is set to 0, so all numbers in the list are below the threshold
assert below_threshold(list(range(-1, -10**6 - 1, -1)), 0) == True, 'Failed to handle case where all numbers are negative.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input l is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not below_threshold('invalid', 10), 'Failed to handle case where the input l is not a list.'

#### The input t is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not below_threshold([1, 2, 3], 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input t is not an integer.'

#### The list contains elements that are not integers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not below_threshold([1, 2, 'invalid', 4], 5), 'Failed to handle case where the list contains elements that are not integers.'

#### The threshold is a negative number, so the function should return False
assert below_threshold([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -10) == False, 'Failed to handle case where the threshold is a negative number.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(below_threshold))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
