# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The input string has a single word and is already sorted, so the output should be the same as the input
assert anti_shuffle('Hi') == 'Hi', 'Failed to handle a single-word input.'

### The input string has a single word, so the output should be rearranged in ascending order based on their ASCII values
assert anti_shuffle('hello') == 'ehllo', 'Failed to handle a single-word input.'

### The input string has multiple words, and the characters in each word are rearranged in ascending order based on their ASCII values
### The order of words and blank spaces in the sentence is preserved
assert anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') == 'Hello !!!Wdlor', 'Failed to handle multiple words and preserve the order of words and spaces.'

### The input string contains special characters and non-alphabetic characters
### The function should handle these characters and rearrange the alphabetic characters in ascending order based on ASCII values
assert anti_shuffle('H@e*llo!') == '!*@Hello', 'Failed to handle special characters and non-alphabetic characters in the input string.'

## Edge Cases
### The input string is empty, so the function should return an empty string
assert anti_shuffle('') == '', 'Failed to handle an empty input string.'

### The input string has no words, so the function should return an empty string
assert anti_shuffle(' ') == '', 'Failed to handle an input string with no words.'

### The input string has multiple spaces between words, so the function should treat them as a single space
assert anti_shuffle('Hello   World') == 'Hello Wdlor', 'Failed to handle multiple spaces between words.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input string contains 10^6 characters, all of which are the same character 'a'
### The output string should also contain 10^6 characters, all of which are the character 'a'
assert anti_shuffle('a' * 10**6) == 'a' * 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error to indicate the input is not valid
assert not anti_shuffle(1234), 'Failed to handle a non-string input.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(anti_shuffle))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
