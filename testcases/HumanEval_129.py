# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The minimum path of length 4 starts at cell (1, 1) and goes through cells (0, 1), (1, 1), and (0, 1)
assert minPath([[2, 4, 6], [7, 1, 9], [3, 5, 8]], 4) == [1, 4, 1, 4], 'Failed to find the minimum path of length 4.'

### The minimum path of length 1 starts at cell (1, 1) and stays in that cell
assert minPath([[5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], 1) == [1], 'Failed to find the minimum path of length 1.'

## Edge Cases
### '1' is located at the upper left corner
assert minPath([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], 3) == [1, 2, 1], 'Failed to handle case where 1 is at upper left corner.'

### '1' is located at the upper right corner
assert minPath([[3, 1], [2, 4]], 4) == [1, 3, 1, 3], 'Failed to handle case where 1 is at upper right corner.'

### '1' is located at the bottom left corner
assert minPath([[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [1, 8, 9]], 3) == [1, 5, 1], 'Failed to handle case where 1 is at bottom left corner.'

### '1' is located at the bottom right corner
assert minPath([[5, 7, 3], [9, 8, 4], [2, 6, 1]], 5) == [1, 4, 1, 4, 1], 'Failed to handle case where 1 is at bottom right corner.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The grid has 1000 rows and 1000 columns, and the minimum path of length 10 is to alternately visit (684, 804) and (685, 804) repeatedly
### Each cell in the grid contains a unique integer from 1 to 10^6
assert minPath([[(524287 * (i * 1000 + j)) % 1_000_001 for j in range(1, 1001)] for i in range(1000)], 10) == [1, 286477, 1, 286477, 1, 286477, 1, 286477, 1, 286477], 'Failed to handle large input.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The grid is empty, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath([], 5), 'Failed to handle an empty grid.'

#### The grid has only one cell, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath([[1]], 1), 'Failed to handle a grid with a single cell.'

#### The k input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input k is not an integer.'

#### The grid input is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath('invalid', 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input grid is not a list.'

#### The grid has unexpected shape, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 2), 'Failed to handle case where the input grid is not square shaped.'

#### The grid contains non-integer values, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath([[1, 2], ['invalid', 4]], 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input grid contains non-integer values.'

#### The grid contains duplicate values, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath([[1, 2], [2, 4]], 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input grid contains duplicate values.'

#### The k value is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not minPath([[1, 2], [3, 4]], -1), 'Failed to handle case where the input k is negative.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(minPath))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
