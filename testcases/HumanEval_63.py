# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The 1st element in the FibFib sequence is 0
assert fibfib(1) == 0, 'Failed to compute the 1st element of the FibFib sequence.'

### The 5th element in the FibFib sequence is 4
assert fibfib(5) == 4, 'Failed to compute the 5th element of the FibFib sequence.'

### The 8th element in the FibFib sequence is 24
assert fibfib(8) == 24, 'Failed to compute the 8th element of the FibFib sequence.'

## Edge Cases
### The 0th element in the FibFib sequence is 0
assert fibfib(0) == 0, 'Failed to compute the 0th element of the FibFib sequence.'

### The -5th element in the FibFib sequence is not defined, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not fibfib(-5), 'Failed to handle negative input.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input is large, so the function should return the result within 5 seconds
assert fibfib(100) == 53324762928098149064722658, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input is not an integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not fibfib('invalid'), 'Failed to handle non-integer input.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(fibfib))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
