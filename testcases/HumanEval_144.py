# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The product of "1/5" and "5/1" is 1, which is a whole number
assert simplify("1/5", "5/1") == True, 'Failed to simplify the expression correctly.'

### The product of "1/6" and "2/1" is 1/3, which is not a whole number
assert simplify("1/6", "2/1") == False, 'Failed to simplify the expression correctly.'

### The product of "7/10" and "10/2" is 7/2, which is not a whole number
assert simplify("7/10", "10/2") == False, 'Failed to simplify the expression correctly.'

## Edge Cases
### The product of "1/1" and "1/1" is 1, which is a whole number
assert simplify("1/1", "1/1") == True, 'Failed to simplify the expression correctly when both fractions are equal.'

### The product of "1/2" and "3/4" is 3/8, which is not a whole number
assert simplify("1/2", "3/4") == False, 'Failed to simplify the expression correctly when the result is a proper fraction.'

### The product of "2/3" and "3/2" is 1, which is a whole number
assert simplify("2/3", "3/2") == True, 'Failed to simplify the expression correctly when the result is an integer.'

### The product of "4/7" and "7/4" is 1, which is a whole number
assert simplify("4/7", "7/4") == True, 'Failed to simplify the expression correctly when both fractions are reciprocal.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### Satisfied if the function executes within a reasonable time for all inputs

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The x input is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify(1/2, "3/4"), 'Failed to handle case where the x input is not a string.'

#### The n input is an empty string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify("1/2", ""), 'Failed to handle case where the n input is an empty string.'

#### The x input is an invalid fraction string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify("1/2/3", "3/4"), 'Failed to handle case where the x input is an invalid fraction string.'

#### The n input is an invalid fraction string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify("1/2", "3/4/5"), 'Failed to handle case where the n input is an invalid fraction string.'

#### The x input has zero as the denominator, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify("1/0", "3/4"), 'Failed to handle case where the x input has zero as the denominator.'

#### The x input has zero as the numerator, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify("0/1", "3/4"), 'Failed to handle case where the x input has zero as the numerator.'

#### The n input has zero as the denominator, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify("1/2", "3/0"), 'Failed to handle case where the n input has zero as the denominator.'

#### The n input has zero as the numerator, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not simplify("1/2", "0/4"), 'Failed to handle case where the n input has zero as the numerator.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(simplify))
assert result.total_complexity <= 10, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
