# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The number of mango fruits is 19 - 5 - 6 = 8
assert fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) == 8, 'Failed to calculate the number of mango fruits correctly.'

### The number of mango fruits is 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
assert fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) == 2, 'Failed to calculate the number of mango fruits correctly.'

### The number of mango fruits is 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
assert fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) == 95, 'Failed to calculate the number of mango fruits correctly.'

### The number of mango fruits is 120 - 100 - 1 = 19
assert fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) == 19, 'Failed to calculate the number of mango fruits correctly.'

## Edge Cases
### The string is empty, so the number of mango fruits is equal to the total number of fruits in the basket
assert fruit_distribution("", 10) == 10, 'Failed to handle an empty string.'

### The string does not mention any fruits, so the number of mango fruits is equal to the total number of fruits in the basket
assert fruit_distribution("No fruits mentioned", 5) == 5, 'Failed to handle the case where no fruits are mentioned in the string.'

## Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
### Performance Requirements
### The string contains 10^6 strings, all of which are the string '1 apples'
### The number of fruits in the basket is 10^9
### The number of apple fruits is 10^9 - 10^6
assert fruit_distribution("1 apples " * 10**6, 10**9) == 10**9 - 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The string contains a negative number of oranges, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not fruit_distribution("5 apples and -6 oranges", 19), 'Failed to handle case where the input string contains a negative number of fruits.'

#### The string contains a non-integer number of apples, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not fruit_distribution("2.5 apples and 3 oranges", 100), 'Failed to handle case where the input string contains a non-integer number of fruits.'

#### The string is not a string, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not fruit_distribution(123, 10), 'Failed to handle case where the input string is not a string.'

#### The input number of fruits is negative, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", -10), 'Failed to handle case where the input number of fruits is negative.'

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(fruit_distribution))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
