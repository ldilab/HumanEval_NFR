# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The even digits between 2 and 8 are [2, 4, 6, 8]
assert generate_integers(2, 8) == [2, 4, 6, 8], 'Failed to return the correct even digits.'

### The even digits between 8 and 2 are [2, 4, 6, 8]
### The order of the input should not affect the result
assert generate_integers(8, 2) == [2, 4, 6, 8], 'Failed to handle case where a is greater than b.'

### There are no even digits between 10 and 14, so the function should return an empty list
assert generate_integers(10, 14) == [], 'Failed to handle case where there are no even digits between a and b.'

## Edge Cases
### The digits between 1 and 1 is [1]
### The input range contains only one digit, which is odd
assert generate_integers(1, 1) == [], 'Failed to handle case where a and b are the same and odd.'

### The digits between 1 and 0 is [0,1]
### The input range contains only two digits, which are odd
assert generate_integers(1, 0) == [0], 'Failed to handle case where a and b are the same and odd.'

### The even digits between 2 and 2 is [2]
### The input range contains only one digit, which is even
assert generate_integers(2, 2) == [2], 'Failed to handle case where a and b are the same and even.'

### The even digits between 2 and 1 is [1,2]
### The input range contains only one digit, which is even
assert generate_integers(2, 1) == [2], 'Failed to handle case where a and b are the same and even.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The input range is from 1 to 10^6
### The even digits between 1 and 10^6 are [2, 4, 6, 8]
assert generate_integers(1, 10**6) == [2, 4, 6, 8], 'Failed to handle large input range.'

### The input range is from 1 to 10^6
### The even digits between 10^6 and 1 are [2, 4, 6, 8]
### The order of the input should not affect the result
assert generate_integers(10**6, 1) == [2, 4, 6, 8], 'Failed to handle case where a is greater than b.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input `a` is not a positive integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not generate_integers('invalid', 5), 'Failed to handle case where the input a is not a positive integer.'

#### The input `b` is not a positive integer, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not generate_integers(5, 'invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input b is not a positive integer.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 10
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(generate_integers))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 10 by Radon.'
