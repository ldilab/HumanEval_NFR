# Test Cases Regarding Functional Requirements
## General Cases
### The squared numbers in the list are [1^2, 2^2, 3^2] = [1, 4, 9]
### The sum of squared numbers is 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
assert sum_squares([1, 2, 3]) == 14, 'Failed to calculate the sum of squared numbers correctly.'

### The squared numbers in the list are [1^2, 4^2, 9^2] = [1, 16, 81]
### The sum of squared numbers is 1 + 16 + 81 = 98
assert sum_squares([1, 4, 9]) == 98, 'Failed to calculate the sum of squared numbers correctly.'

### The squared numbers in the list are [1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2] = [1, 9, 25, 49]
### The sum of squared numbers is 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 84
assert sum_squares([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 84, 'Failed to calculate the sum of squared numbers correctly.'

### The squared numbers in the list are [ceil(1.4)^2, ceil(4.2)^2, ceil(0)^2] = [2^2, 5^2, 0^2] = [4, 25, 0]
### The sum of squared numbers is 4 + 25 + 0 = 29
assert sum_squares([1.4, 4.2, 0]) == 29, 'Failed to calculate the sum of squared numbers correctly.'

### The squared numbers in the list are [ceil(-2.4)^2, ceil(1)^2, ceil(1)^2] = [-2^2, 1^2, 1^2] = [4, 1, 1]
### The sum of squared numbers is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
assert sum_squares([-2.4, 1, 1]) == 6, 'Failed to calculate the sum of squared numbers correctly.'

## Edge Cases
### The input list is empty, so the function should return 0
assert sum_squares([]) == 0, 'Failed to handle an empty input list.'

### The list contains negative numbers, so the function should round them to the nearest upper integer (ceiling) and calculate the sum of squared numbers
### The squared numbers in the list are [ceil(-2)^2, ceil(-1)^2, ceil(0)^2] = [-2^2, -1^2, 0^2] = [4, 1, 0]
### The sum of squared numbers is 4 + 1 + 0 = 5
assert sum_squares([-2.4, -1.2, 0]) == 5, 'Failed to handle negative numbers in the list.'

### The list contains floating-point numbers, so the function should round them to the nearest upper integer (ceiling) and calculate the sum of squared numbers
### The squared numbers in the list are [ceil(1.6)^2, ceil(2.4)^2, ceil(3.8)^2] = [2^2, 3^2, 4^2] = [4, 9, 16]
### The sum of squared numbers is 4 + 9 + 16 = 29
assert sum_squares([1.6, 2.4, 3.8]) == 29, 'Failed to handle floating-point numbers in the list.'

# Test Cases Regarding Non-functional Requirements
## Performance Requirements
### The list contains 10^6 elements, all of which are 1
### The squared numbers in the list are [1^2, 1^2, ..., 1^2] = [1, 1, ..., 1]
### The sum of squared numbers is 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (10^6 times) = 10^6
assert sum_squares([1] * 10**6) == 10**6, 'Failed to handle large input size.'

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
#### The input lst is not a list, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not sum_squares('invalid'), 'Failed to handle case where the input lst is not a list.'

#### The input lst contains elements that are not numbers, so the function should handle the case not to raise error
assert not sum_squares([1, 3, 'invalid', 5, 7]), 'Failed to handle non-numeric elements in the list.'

### Reliability
#### Satisfied if no errors occur across all test cases

### Maintainability
#### Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity using Radon
#### Check if the Cyclomatic Complexity is less than or equal to 5
import inspect
from radon.visitors import ComplexityVisitor
result = ComplexityVisitor.from_code(inspect.getsource(sum_squares))
assert result.total_complexity <= 5, 'Failed to have a Cyclomatic Complexity less than or equal to 5 by Radon.'
