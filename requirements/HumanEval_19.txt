# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `numbers` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should sort the numbers in the input string from smallest to largest and return the sorted string.
- The input string will be space-delimited and consist of valid numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string as input, returning an empty string.
- Handle input strings with duplicate numberals, ensuring the duplicates are preserved in the sorted output string.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of numberals in the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of numberals in the input string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.
- Handle invalid numberals in the input string.
- Handle numberals in a different case (e.g., 'One', 'two', 'THREE').

### Reliability
- Ensure proper handling of empty strings and strings with leading/trailing spaces.
- Handle the case where the input string contains additional non-numberal words.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
