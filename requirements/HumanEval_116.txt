# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of non-negative integers `arr` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should sort the input list `arr` in ascending order based on the number of ones in the binary representation of each number.
- If multiple numbers have the same number of ones, they should be sorted based on their decimal value.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `arr` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle a `arr` list containing only one number, returning the same list.
- Handle a `arr` list containing negative integers, treating them as non-negative integers and sorting them accordingly.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n * log n), where n is the length of the `arr` list.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `arr` list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `arr` input or non-integer elements in the `arr` list.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
- Use meaningful variable names and clear code organization.
- Include comments to explain complex parts of the code, if necessary.
