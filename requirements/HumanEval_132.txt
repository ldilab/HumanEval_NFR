# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
- A valid subsequence of brackets is defined as a sequence of opening and closing brackets that can be nested within each other in a valid manner.
- The function should return False if there is no valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string input, returning False.
- Handle a string input that contains characters other than square brackets, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large input strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
