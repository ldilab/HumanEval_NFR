# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of floats `numbers` as input.
- It returns a tuple of two floats.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should select and return two numbers from the `numbers` list that are the closest to each other.
- The numbers in the returned tuple should be in ascending order, with the smaller number first.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where the `numbers` list has less than two elements, raising a ValueError or returning None.
- Handle the case where multiple pairs of numbers have the same minimum difference, returning any of them.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the `numbers` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `numbers` input or non-float elements in the `numbers` list.
- Handle the case where the `numbers` list has duplicate elements.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `numbers` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
