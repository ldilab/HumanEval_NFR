# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two lists of integers `game` and `guess` as input.
- Both `game` and `guess` should have the same length.
- The function returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should compare the guesses with the scores and return a list of the same length, denoting how far off each guess was.
- If a guess is correct, the corresponding value in the returned list should be 0.
- If a guess is incorrect, the corresponding value in the returned list should be the absolute difference between the guess and the score.

## Edge Cases
- Handle empty `game` and `guess` lists, returning empty lists.
- Handle non-list inputs for `game` and `guess`, returning None.
- Handle different lengths of `game` and `guess`, raising an error or returning None.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `game` or `guess` lists.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `game` or `guess` lists.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list inputs or non-integer elements in the `game` and `guess` lists.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing the `game` and `guess` lists.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
