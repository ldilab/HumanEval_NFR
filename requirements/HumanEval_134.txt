# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and any other potential errors.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `txt` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the last character of the input string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word (a group of characters separated by spaces). Otherwise, it should return False.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty input string, returning False.
- Handle the case where the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word.
- Handle the case where the last character is an alphabetical character but is part of a word.
- Handle the case where the last character is not an alphabetical character.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string `txt`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing characters in the input string.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
