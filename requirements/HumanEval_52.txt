# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `l` and a threshold integer `t` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if all numbers in `l` are below the threshold `t`. Otherwise, it should return False.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `l` list, returning True.
- Handle the case where all numbers in `l` are equal to the threshold `t`, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `l` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `l` input or a non-integer `t`.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `l` list or a negative `t`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
