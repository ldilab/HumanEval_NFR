# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a positive integer `n` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list where each element represents the number of stones in each level of the pile.
- The number of stones in the first level is equal to `n`.
- The number of stones in the next level is determined by the following rules:
    - If `n` is odd, the number of stones in the next level is the next odd number.
    - If `n` is even, the number of stones in the next level is the next even number.

## Edge Cases
- Handle a `n` value of 0, returning an empty list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the value of `n`.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the value of `n`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer `n` input or negative `n`.

### Reliability
- Avoid arithmetic errors when calculating the number of stones in the next level.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
