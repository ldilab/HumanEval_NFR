# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes an integer `decimal` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should convert the `decimal` number to its binary representation.
- The binary representation should have the 'db' prefix and suffix.
- Each character in the binary representation should be '0' or '1'.

## Edge Cases
- Handle a non-integer `decimal` input.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the value of `decimal`.
- Space complexity: O(log n).

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-integer `decimal` input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
