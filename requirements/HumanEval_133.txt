# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of numbers `lst` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the sum of squared numbers in the given list, where each element is rounded to the nearest upper integer (ceiling) before squaring.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `lst`, returning 0.
- Handle non-numeric elements in `lst`.
- Handle negative numbers in `lst`.
- Handle floating-point numbers in `lst`.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `lst`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `lst` input.
- Handle non-numeric elements in `lst`.

### Reliability
- Avoid arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow) when calculating the sum of squared numbers.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
