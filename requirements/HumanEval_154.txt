# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two strings `a` and `b` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if `b` or any of its rotations is a substring of `a`, and False otherwise.

## Edge Cases
- Handle empty strings for `a` and/or `b`, returning False.
- Handle the case where `b` is longer than `a`, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the longer string between `a` and `b`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string inputs for `a` and `b`.
- Handle Unicode characters in the strings.
- Handle cases where `a` or `b` contains special characters, numbers, or spaces.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
