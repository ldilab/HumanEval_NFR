# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list `l` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a new list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` at the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `l` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where all indices in `l` are divisible by three, returning `l` sorted.
- Handle the case where no indices in `l` are divisible by three, returning `l` unchanged.
- Handle non-integer elements in `l`.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the length of the input list `l`.
- Space complexity: O(n) to store the sorted values.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list input or a non-integer element in the `l` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `l` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
