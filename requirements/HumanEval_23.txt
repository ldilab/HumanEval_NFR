# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `string` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the length of the given string.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string, returning 0.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1) (constant time complexity).
- Space complexity: O(1) (constant space complexity).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large strings, providing results within 1 second.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string inputs.

### Reliability
- Ensure the function returns correct results for all valid inputs.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
