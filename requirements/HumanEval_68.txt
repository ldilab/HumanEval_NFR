# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list containing the smallest even value in `arr` and its index.
- If there are multiple nodes with the same smallest even value, the function should return the node with the smallest index.
- If there are no even values in the array or the array is empty, the function should return an empty list.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `arr` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where no even values are found in `arr`, returning an empty list.
- Handle multiple even values with the same minimum value, returning the one with the smallest index.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `arr` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `arr` input or non-integer elements in the `arr` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `arr` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
