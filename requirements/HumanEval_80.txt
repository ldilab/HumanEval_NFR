# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `s` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the string `s` is happy and False otherwise.
- A string `s` is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string, returning False.
- Handle a string with length less than 3, returning False.
- Handle a string with consecutive repeating characters, returning False.
- Handle a string with distinct consecutive characters, returning True.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string `s`.
- Space complexity: O(1).

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.
- Handle input with non-alphabetic characters.
- Handle input with leading/trailing whitespaces.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
