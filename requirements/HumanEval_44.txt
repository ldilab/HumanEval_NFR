# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two integers `x` and `base` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should convert the number `x` to a string representation in the given `base` and return it.

## Edge Cases
- Handle a non-integer `x` or `base`, returning an empty string.
- Handle a negative `x`, returning an empty string.
- Handle a `base` greater than 9, returning an empty string.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(log(x)) where x is the value of `x`.
- Space complexity: O(log(x)).

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer `x` or `base` input.
- Handle a negative `x` or a `base` greater than 9.

### Reliability
- Ensure the function works correctly for a wide range of input values.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
