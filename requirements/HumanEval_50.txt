# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and other potential errors.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string.
- The `decode_shift` function takes a string `s` encoded with the `encode_shift` function as input and returns the decoded string.

## Expected Behavior
- The `encode_shift` function should return a string where each character is shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet.
- The `decode_shift` function should return the decoded string from an encoded string.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string input for both `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`, returning an empty string.
- Handle non-string inputs for both `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`, raising a `TypeError`.
- Handle inputs with non-alphabetic characters for `encode_shift`, leaving them unchanged in the encoded string.
- Handle inputs with non-alphabetic characters for `decode_shift`, leaving them unchanged in the decoded string.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string inputs or empty strings for `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`.
- Handle non-alphabetic characters in the input strings.
- Ensure the returned strings have the same length as the input strings.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
