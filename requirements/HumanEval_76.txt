# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two integers `x` and `n` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return `True` if `x` is a simple power of `n`, and `False` otherwise.
- `x` is considered a simple power of `n` if `n**int = x`, where `int` is an integer.
- For example:
  - `is_simple_power(1, 4)` should return `True` since `1 = 4**0`.
  - `is_simple_power(2, 2)` should return `True` since `2 = 2**1`.
  - `is_simple_power(8, 2)` should return `True` since `8 = 2**3`.
  - `is_simple_power(3, 2)` should return `False` since there is no integer `int` such that `2**int = 3`.
  - `is_simple_power(3, 1)` should return `False` since `1**int = 1`, but `1 != 3`.
  - `is_simple_power(5, 3)` should return `False` since there is no integer `int` such that `3**int = 5`.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(log(x)) where `x` is the larger of `x` and `n`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer `x` or `n` input.
- Handle negative `x` or `n`.

### Reliability
- Ensure the function returns the correct boolean value according to the definition of a simple power.
- Avoid arithmetic errors while calculating `n**int`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
