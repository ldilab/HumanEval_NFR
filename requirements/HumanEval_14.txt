# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `string` as input.
- It returns a list of strings.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list of all prefixes of the input string, from the shortest to the longest.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string input, returning an empty list.
- Handle a single-character string input, returning a list containing only that character.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely long input strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
