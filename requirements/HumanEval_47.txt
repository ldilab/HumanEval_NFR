# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `l` as input.
- It returns a float representing the median of the elements in the list.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the median of the elements in the input list.
- If the number of elements in the list is odd, the median is the middle element.
- If the number of elements in the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `l`, returning `None`.
- Handle a list with a single element, returning that element as the median.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `l` input.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `l` list.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
