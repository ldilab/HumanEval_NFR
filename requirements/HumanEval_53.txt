# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two integer arguments, `x` and `y`.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the sum of `x` and `y`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle non-integer `x` or `y` arguments.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1).
- Space complexity: O(1).

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer `x` or `y` input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.
