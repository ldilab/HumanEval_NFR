# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the length of the string is a prime number, and False otherwise.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string, returning False.
- Handle a string with a length of 1, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(sqrt(n)) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely long strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string input.

### Reliability
- None specified.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
