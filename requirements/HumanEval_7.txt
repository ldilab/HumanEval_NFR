# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of strings `strings` and a substring `substring` as input.
- It returns a list of strings.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list of strings from `strings` that contain the given `substring`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `strings` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where no string in `strings` contains the `substring`, returning an empty list.
- Handle multiple strings containing the `substring` with the same frequency, returning any of them.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n*m) where n is the length of the `strings` list and m is the length of the longest string in `strings`.
- Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of strings containing the `substring`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `strings` input or a non-string `substring`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
