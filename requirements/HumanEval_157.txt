# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
- It returns a boolean value: True if the three sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the three sides `a`, `b`, and `c` form a right-angled triangle, and False otherwise.
- A right-angled triangle is defined as a triangle in which one angle is a right angle (90 degrees).

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where any of the sides `a`, `b`, or `c` is equal to 0, returning False.
- Handle the case where any of the sides `a`, `b`, or `c` is negative, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1).
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input for `a`, `b`, or `c`.
- Handle floating-point numbers for `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Reliability
- Ensure the function handles potential arithmetic errors, such as overflow or division by zero.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
