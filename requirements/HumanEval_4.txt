# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of floating-point numbers `numbers` as input.
- It returns a floating-point number as the mean absolute deviation.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should calculate the mean absolute deviation of the input list, which is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the list.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `numbers` list, returning 0 as the mean absolute deviation.
- Handle the case where `numbers` contains only one element, returning 0 as the mean absolute deviation.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `numbers` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `numbers` input or non-floating-point elements in the `numbers` list.
- Handle NaN or infinite values in the `numbers` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `numbers` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
