# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should sort the input list `nums` in ascending order based on the sum of the digits of each number.
- If two numbers have the same sum of digits, they should be ordered based on their index in the original list.
- The function should return the sorted list.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty input list, returning an empty list.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `nums` list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n * m * log n) where n is the length of the `nums` list and m is the average number of digits in the numbers.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the sorted list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `nums` input.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `nums` elements.
- Handle large numbers without overflow errors.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
