# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two variables `a` and `b` as input.
- It returns a variable of the same type as the input variables, representing the larger value. If the values are equal, it returns None.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should compare the values of `a` and `b` and return the larger value, taking into account the variable types.
- If both values are equal, it should return None.

## Edge Cases
- Handle non-integer or non-float input variables, returning None.
- Handle non-numeric string representations, returning None.
- Handle string representations of real numbers with both "." and "," as the decimal separator.
- Handle integer and float inputs, returning the larger value.
- Handle string and numeric inputs, returning the larger value if possible. If not, return None.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1).
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 1 second.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-numeric input variables.
- Handle string representations of real numbers with incorrect formatting, such as missing or multiple decimal separators.
- Handle NaN (Not a Number) and infinity values in the inputs.
- Handle case sensitivity in string comparisons.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
