# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors, and other potential exceptions.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- The code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a positive floating-point number as input.
- It returns the decimal part of the number as a float.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the decimal part of the given floating-point number.

## Edge Cases
- Handle negative numbers, returning the decimal part as a positive float.
- Handle zero as input, returning zero as the decimal part.
- Handle large input numbers, ensuring efficiency and avoiding overflow.
- Handle extremely small input numbers, ensuring precision and avoiding underflow.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1).
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large or small input numbers, providing results within a few milliseconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-float input, returning an error or a default value.
- Handle very large or very small input numbers without causing arithmetic errors or loss of precision.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
