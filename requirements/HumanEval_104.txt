# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of positive integers `x` as input.
- It returns a sorted list of positive integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list of all elements from `x` that do not contain any even digits.
- The returned list should be sorted in increasing order.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `x` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where no elements in `x` satisfy the condition, returning an empty list.
- Handle multiple elements with the same value, returning any of them.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n * m) where n is the length of the `x` list and m is the average number of digits in each element of the list.
- Space complexity: O(k) where k is the length of the returned list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `x` input or non-integer elements in the `x` list.
- Handle negative integers in the `x` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `x` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
