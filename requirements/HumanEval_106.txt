# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes an integer `n` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list of size `n` where the value of the element at index `i` is the factorial of `i` if `i` is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` otherwise.
- The index `i` starts from 1.
- The factorial of `i` is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to `i`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle negative input `n`, returning an empty list.
- Handle a zero input `n`, returning an empty list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the input `n`.
- Space complexity: O(n).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-integer input `n`.

### Reliability
- Avoid arithmetic operation errors while calculating factorials or sums.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
