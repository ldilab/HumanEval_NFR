# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of numbers `lst` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the sum of the squares of the numbers in `lst` that are positive integers and odd.
- Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
- If the input list is empty, return 0.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `lst`, returning 0.
- Handle cases where all numbers in `lst` are negative or not integers, returning 0.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `lst` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `lst` input.
- Handle non-numeric elements in the `lst` list.
- Handle floating-point numbers in the `lst` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `lst` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
