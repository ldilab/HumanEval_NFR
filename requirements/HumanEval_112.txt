# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and other potential errors.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two strings `s` and `c` as input.
- It returns a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the palindrome check.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should delete all characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`.
- It should then check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
- The function should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the palindrome check.

## Edge Cases
- Handle empty `s` and/or `c` strings, returning an empty string and False for the palindrome check.
- Handle non-string `s` and/or `c` inputs, returning an empty string and False for the palindrome check.
- Handle cases where the resulting string is a palindrome, returning the result string and True for the palindrome check.
- Handle cases where the resulting string is not a palindrome, returning the result string and False for the palindrome check.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n + m) where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `c`.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of `s`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string characters in `s` and/or `c`.
- Handle empty `s` and/or `c` strings.
- Handle special characters and whitespaces in `s` and/or `c`.

### Reliability
- Ensure the function handles all characters in `s` correctly, without missing any.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
