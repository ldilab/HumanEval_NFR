# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a grid as a list of lists `grid` and a positive integer `k` as input.
- The grid is guaranteed to have at least 2 rows and 2 columns.
- Each cell of the grid contains a unique integer in the range [1, N * N] inclusive, where N is the number of rows or columns in the grid.
- The function returns an ordered list of integers representing the minimum path of length k in the grid.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should find the minimum path of length k in the grid, starting from any cell and moving to neighboring cells.
- The minimum path should visit exactly k cells, but not necessarily distinct cells.
- The minimum path should not go off the grid.
- The minimum path should be the lexicographically smallest path among all possible paths of length k.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty grid, returning an empty list.
- Handle a grid with only one cell, returning a list with that cell's value.
- Handle a grid with multiple cells with the same value.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(N^2 * k * log(k)) where N is the number of rows or columns in the grid.
- Space complexity: O(N^2) for the "visited" list.
- Ensure efficiency even for grids with a large number of cells, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `grid` input or a non-integer `k`.
- Handle grids with non-integer values or non-unique values.
- Handle a negative `k` value.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing grid cells.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
