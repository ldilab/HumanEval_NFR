# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `text` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the input string `text` is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `text` string, returning True.
- Handle a single-character `text` string, returning True.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `text` string.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the reversed string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.
- Handle input with special characters, spaces, and punctuation marks.
- Handle non-alphanumeric characters in the input string.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `text` characters.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
- Use meaningful variable names and provide clear comments.
