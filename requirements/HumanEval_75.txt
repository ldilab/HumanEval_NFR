# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes an integer `a` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the given number `a` is the product of 3 prime numbers, and False otherwise.

## Constraints
- The input `a` is less than 100.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(sqrt(a)) where a is the input number.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for the largest possible input, providing results within 1 second.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input for `a`.
- Handle negative input for `a`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
