# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should circularly shift the digits of `x` to the right by `shift` positions.
- If `shift` is greater than the number of digits in `x`, it should return the digits reversed.
- The function should return the result as a string.

## Edge Cases
- Handle a negative `x` input, returning the result as a negative string.
- Handle a non-integer `x` input or a non-integer `shift` input.
- Handle the case where `x` is 0, returning "0".
- Handle the case where `shift` is 0, returning `x` as a string.
- Handle the case where `shift` is equal to or greater than the number of digits in `x`, returning the digits reversed.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of digits in `x`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer digits in `x`.
- Handle a zero `shift` input.
- Handle a negative `shift` input.
- Handle non-integer `shift` input.
- Handle a non-integer `x` input.
