# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where `n` is 0, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where `n` is 1, returning `[1]`.
- Handle the case where `n` is 2, returning `[1, 3]`.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the value of `n`.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the value of `n`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer `n` input or negative `n`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
