# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of values `values` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should filter the input list `values` and return a new list containing only the integer values from the input list.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `values` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where there are no integer values in the `values` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle non-integer values in the `values` list, skipping them in the output list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `values` list.
- Space complexity: O(1) (excluding the output list).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `values` input.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `values` list.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
- The code should be modular and well-organized, with meaningful variable names and clear comments.
