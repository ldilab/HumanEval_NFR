# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a positive integer `n` as input.
- It returns a tuple of two integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should count the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n) inclusive.
- It should return a tuple where the first element is the count of even palindromes and the second element is the count of odd palindromes.

## Constraints
- The input integer `n` will be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where n is 1, returning (0, 1) as there is only one palindrome (1) and it is odd.
- Handle the case where n is 2, returning (1, 1) as there are two palindromes (1 and 2), one even and one odd.
- Handle the case where n is a large number close to the upper constraint (1000), ensuring that the function executes within a reasonable time frame.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the input integer `n`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input for `n` and return an error or default value.
- Ensure that the function handles the edge cases mentioned above correctly.
- Validate the input range for `n` to ensure it falls within the specified constraints.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while looping through the range (1, n).

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
