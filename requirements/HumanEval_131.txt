# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a positive integer `n` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the product of the odd digits in `n`.
- If all digits in `n` are even, the function should return 0.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where `n` is 0, returning 0.
- Handle the case where `n` has only one digit, returning the product of that digit if it is odd or 0 if it is even.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(log10(n)) where n is the input number.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer `n` input or negative `n`.
- Ensure the function works correctly with large input numbers.

### Reliability
- Avoid arithmetic operation errors, such as integer overflow, while computing the product of the odd digits.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
