# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two string representations of fractions, `x` and `n`, as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the product of `x` and `n` evaluates to a whole number, and False otherwise.

## Edge Cases
- Handle invalid inputs, such as non-string or empty inputs, returning False.
- Handle fractions with zero as the denominator, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1).
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 1 second.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string inputs or empty strings for `x` and `n`.
- Handle invalid fraction strings, such as those with non-numeric characters or missing numerators/denominators.

### Reliability
- Ensure that the function correctly checks if the product of `x` and `n` is a whole number.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
