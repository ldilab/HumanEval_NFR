# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two tuples `interval1` and `interval2`, representing intervals, as input.
- Each tuple has two integers representing the start and end values of the interval.
- The function returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should determine whether the length of the intersection between `interval1` and `interval2` is a prime number.
- If the length of the intersection is a prime number, the function should return "YES".
- If the two intervals don't intersect or the length is not a prime number, the function should return "NO".

## Edge Cases
- Handle non-tuple input for `interval1` or `interval2`, returning "NO".
- Handle non-integer elements in the `interval1` or `interval2` tuples, returning "NO".
- Handle cases where the start value of an interval is greater than the end value, returning "NO".

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the difference between the end and start values of the intersection.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-tuple input or non-integer elements in the tuples, returning "NO".
- Handle cases where the start value is greater than the end value, returning "NO".

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing elements of the tuples.
