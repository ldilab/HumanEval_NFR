# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `delimeter` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should insert the `delimeter` number between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `numbers` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where `delimeter` is not an integer.
- Handle the case where `numbers` list contains non-integer elements.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `numbers` list.
- Space complexity: O(n) due to the creation of a new list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `numbers` input or a non-integer `delimeter`.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `numbers` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `numbers` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
