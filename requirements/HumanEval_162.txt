# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, attribute errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `text` as input.
- It returns a string representing the MD5 hash of the input `text`.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the MD5 hash equivalent of the input `text`.
- If the input `text` is an empty string, the function should return None.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where `text` is an empty string, returning None.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `text` string.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely long input strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input for `text`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
