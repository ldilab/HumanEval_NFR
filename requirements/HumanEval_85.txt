# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a non-empty list of integers `lst` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the sum of even elements that are at odd indices in the given list.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where there are no even elements at odd indices, returning 0.
- Handle non-integer elements in the list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `lst` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list input.
- Handle empty list input.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `lst` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
