# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes an integer `n` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the `n`th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 0, returning an error or raising an exception.
- Handle the case where `n` is larger than the maximum possible `n` that can be calculated within a reasonable time frame.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the input `n`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input for `n` or negative values of `n`.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing Fibonacci numbers.
- Ensure accurate calculation of prime numbers.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
