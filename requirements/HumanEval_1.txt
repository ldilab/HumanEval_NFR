# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `paren_string` as input.
- It returns a list of strings.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should separate the groups of nested parentheses in `paren_string` into separate strings and return a list of these strings.
- Each group of nested parentheses should be balanced, with each open parenthesis properly closed.
- The groups should not be nested within each other.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `paren_string`, returning an empty list.
- Handle a `paren_string` with no groups of nested parentheses, returning a list with the original string as the only element.
- Handle a `paren_string` with improperly balanced or nested parentheses, returning an empty list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `paren_string`.
- Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of groups of nested parentheses in the `paren_string`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string `paren_string` input.
- Handle a `paren_string` with non-parenthesis characters.
- Handle a `paren_string` with unbalanced or improperly nested parentheses.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
