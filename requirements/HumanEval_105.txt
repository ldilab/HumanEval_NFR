# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
- It returns a list of strings.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should sort the integers in `arr` that are between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
- The function should reverse the resulting array.
- The function should replace each digit in the reversed array with its corresponding name: "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".
- The function should return the list of names.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `arr`, returning an empty list.
- Handle an `arr` with no integers between 1 and 9, returning an empty list.
- Handle an `arr` with strange numbers (e.g., negative numbers, numbers greater than 9), ignoring them and only considering integers between 1 and 9.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the length of the `arr` list.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `arr` list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `arr` input or non-integer elements in the `arr` list.
- Handle invalid input such as characters or floating-point numbers in the `arr` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `arr` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
