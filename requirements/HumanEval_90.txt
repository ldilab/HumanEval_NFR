# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `lst` as input.
- It returns an integer or None.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the second smallest element in the input list.
- If there is no second smallest element (e.g., the input list has less than 2 elements or contains duplicate elements), the function should return None.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `lst` list, returning None.
- Handle a list with only one element, returning None.
- Handle a list with duplicate elements, returning None if all elements are the same.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list `lst`.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list `lst`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list input or a list containing non-integer elements.

### Reliability
- Ensure the function returns correct results for all valid input cases.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
