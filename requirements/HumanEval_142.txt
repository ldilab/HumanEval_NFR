# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `lst` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should square the integer entry in `lst` if its index is a multiple of 3.
- The function should cube the integer entry in `lst` if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3.
- The function should not change the entries in `lst` whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4.
- The function should return the sum of all entries in `lst` after applying the above transformations.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `lst`, returning 0.
- Handle a non-list input, returning None.
- Handle non-integer elements in `lst`, skipping them during the sum calculation.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `lst`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer elements in `lst`.
- Handle non-list `lst` input.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `lst` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
