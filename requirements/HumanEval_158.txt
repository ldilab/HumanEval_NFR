# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of strings `words` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the word from the `words` list that has the maximum number of unique characters.
- If there are multiple words with the same maximum number of unique characters, return the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `words` list, returning an empty string.
- Handle the case where all words in `words` are empty strings, returning an empty string.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n * m) where n is the length of the `words` list and m is the average length of the words in the list.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `words` list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `words` input or non-string elements in the `words` list.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
