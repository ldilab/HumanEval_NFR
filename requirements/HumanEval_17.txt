# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `music_string` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should parse the `music_string` and return a list of integers representing the duration of each note.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `music_string`, returning an empty list.
- Handle invalid characters in the `music_string`, skipping them and returning the durations of valid notes.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `music_string`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string `music_string` input.

### Reliability
- Ensure the function can handle any valid music note format and return the correct durations.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
