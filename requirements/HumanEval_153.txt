# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `class_name` and a list of strings `extensions` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should find the strongest extension from the list of extensions based on the given strength calculation and return it in the format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `extensions` list, returning an empty string.
- Handle non-string elements in the `extensions` list.
- Handle an empty `class_name` string, returning an empty string.
- Handle non-string `class_name` input.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `extensions` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `extensions` input or a non-string `class_name`.
- Handle non-string elements in the `extensions` list.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
