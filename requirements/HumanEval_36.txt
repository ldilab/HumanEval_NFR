# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes an integer `n` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 10, returning 0.
- Handle the case where there are no numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7, returning 0.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the value of `n`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-integer `n` input.

### Reliability
- Ensure accurate counting of the digit 7 in the integers less than `n`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: ≤ 10.
