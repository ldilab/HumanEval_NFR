# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes three integers `number`, `need`, and `remaining` as input.
- It returns a list of two integers: [total number of eaten carrots after meals, number of carrots left after meals].

## Expected Behavior
- The function should calculate the total number of eaten carrots after the meals by adding the initial number of eaten carrots to the number of carrots needed to be eaten.
- The function should calculate the number of carrots left after the meals by subtracting the remaining carrots from the total number of eaten carrots.
- If there are not enough remaining carrots, the number of carrots left after the meals should be set to zero.
- The function should return a list containing the total number of eaten carrots after the meals and the number of carrots left after the meals.

## Edge Cases
- Handle negative `number`, `need`, or `remaining` inputs, returning an empty list.
- Handle non-integer inputs for `number`, `need`, or `remaining`, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where the number of carrots needed is zero, returning the initial number of eaten carrots and the remaining carrots as a list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1).
- Space complexity: O(1).

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer inputs for `number`, `need`, or `remaining`.
- Handle negative `number`, `need`, or `remaining` inputs.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
