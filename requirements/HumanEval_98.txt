# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and other potential errors.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `s` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string `s`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string input, returning 0.
- Handle cases where the string does not contain any uppercase vowels in even indices, returning 0.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string `s`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely long strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string input.
- Handle non-alphabetic characters in the string.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
