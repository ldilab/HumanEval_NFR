# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `text` as input.
- It returns a modified string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should replace all spaces in the input string with underscores.
- If the input string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, the function should replace all consecutive spaces with a hyphen '-'.
- The modified string should be returned.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string input, returning an empty string.
- Handle a string with only spaces, returning a string with only underscores.
- Handle a string with consecutive spaces at the beginning or end, replacing them with underscores or a hyphen respectively.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.
- Handle non-space characters in the input string.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
