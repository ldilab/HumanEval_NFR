# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list `l` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a sorted list of unique elements from the input list `l`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `l`, returning an empty list.
- Handle a list with all duplicate elements, returning a list with a single element.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n*log(n)) where n is the length of the input list `l`.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input list `l`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
