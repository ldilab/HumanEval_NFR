# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes three numbers, x, y, and z, as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
- The function should return False in all other cases.

## Edge Cases
- Handle non-integer input numbers, returning False.
- Handle all input numbers being the same, returning False.
- Handle negative input numbers.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(1).
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 1 second.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input numbers.
- Handle non-numeric input values.
- Handle integer overflow.
- Ensure all possible code paths return a value.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
