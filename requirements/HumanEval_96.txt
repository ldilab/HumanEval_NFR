# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return an array of the first `n` prime numbers that are less than `n`.
- The returned list should be in ascending order.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where `n` is 0 or 1, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where `n` is negative, returning an empty list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n√n) where n is the input `n`.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the input `n`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input for `n`.
- Handle negative values for `n`.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing list elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: ≤ 10.
