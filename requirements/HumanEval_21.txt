# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of floats `numbers` as input.
- It returns a list of floats.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should apply a linear transform to the input list `numbers` such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1.
- The rescaling should be done proportionally to maintain the relative differences between the numbers.
- The resulting list should have the same length as the input list.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `numbers` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle a `numbers` list with a single element, returning a list with that element.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `numbers` list.
- Space complexity: O(n) as the function creates a new list to store the rescaled values.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list input or non-float elements in the `numbers` list.
- Handle input lists with less than two elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
