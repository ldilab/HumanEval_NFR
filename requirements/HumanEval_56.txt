# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `brackets` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return `True` if every opening bracket in `brackets` has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string `brackets`, returning `True`.
- Handle the case where there are no opening brackets, returning `True`.
- Handle the case where there are no closing brackets, returning `False`.
- Handle the case where there are unbalanced brackets, returning `False`.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `brackets` string.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
