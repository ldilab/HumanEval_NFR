# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `lst` as input.
- It returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order and has no more than 1 duplicate of the same number.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if the list is sorted in ascending order and has no more than 1 duplicate of the same number.
- The function should return False otherwise.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `lst`, returning True.
- Handle a single-element `lst`, returning True.
- Handle a `lst` with multiple duplicates of the same number, returning False.
- Handle a `lst` that is sorted in descending order, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `lst`.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the count of each element in the `lst`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `lst` input or non-integer elements in the `lst`.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `lst` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
