# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `xs` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the derivative of the polynomial represented by the input list of coefficients `xs`.
- The derivative of a polynomial can be computed by taking the derivative of each term and decreasing the exponent by 1.
- The input `xs` list represents the coefficients of the polynomial in increasing order of exponents.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `xs` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle a single-element `xs` list, returning a list with a single element equal to 0.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `xs` list.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `xs` list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `xs` input or non-integer elements in the `xs` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `xs` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
