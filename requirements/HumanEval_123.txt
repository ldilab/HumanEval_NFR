# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a positive integer `n` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a sorted list that contains the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for the given input `n`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle non-positive integer `n`, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where `n` is already 1, returning a list containing only 1.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(log n) where n is the value of `n`.
- Space complexity: O(log n) to store the Collatz sequence.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input for `n`.
- Handle non-integer elements in the Collatz sequence.

### Reliability
- Avoid infinite loops by following the Collatz sequence rules correctly.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
