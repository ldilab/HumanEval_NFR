# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `k` as input.
- It returns a sorted list of length `k` with the maximum `k` numbers in `arr`.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a sorted list of length `k` containing the `k` maximum numbers from `arr`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `arr` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where `k` is 0, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where `k` is greater than the length of `arr`, returning the sorted `arr` list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the `arr` list due to the sorting operation.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `arr` list, to store the sorted list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `arr` input or a non-integer `k`.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `arr` list.
- Handle negative values for `k`.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `arr` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
