# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `s` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the input string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated.
- Each letter in the input string should be shifted down by two multiplied by two places in the alphabet.
- Non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string as input, returning an empty string.
- Handle a string with only non-alphabetic characters, returning the same string.
- Handle a string with only alphabetic characters, returning the encrypted string.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string input, returning None.
- Handle uppercase letters in the input string, considering them as well.
- Handle Unicode characters, considering only alphabetic characters and ignoring non-alphabetic characters.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
