# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `s` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the sum of the ASCII codes of the uppercase characters in the input string `s`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string input, returning 0.
- Handle the case where there are no uppercase characters in the input string, returning 0.
- Handle the case where the string contains only uppercase characters, returning the sum of their ASCII codes.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input or invalid characters in the string.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
