# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of strings `lst` as input.
- It returns a list of strings.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should delete the strings with odd lengths from the input list.
- The function should return the resulting list with a sorted order.
- The sorting order should be ascending by the length of each word.
- If two words have the same length, the function should sort the list alphabetically.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `lst` list, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where all strings in `lst` have odd lengths, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where all strings in `lst` have the same length, returning the list sorted alphabetically.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(nlogn), where n is the length of the `lst` list.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `lst` list.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `lst` input.
- Handle non-string elements in the `lst` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `lst` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
