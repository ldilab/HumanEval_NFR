# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `l` as input.
- It returns a list of integers.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a list that contains only the positive numbers from the input list `l`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty input list `l`, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where all elements in the input list `l` are negative, returning an empty list.
- Handle the case where all elements in the input list `l` are positive, returning the same list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input list `l`.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list input.
- Handle non-integer elements in the input list `l`.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing elements in the input list `l`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
