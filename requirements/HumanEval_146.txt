# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the number of elements in the `nums` list that are greater than 10 and have both their first and last digits odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `nums` list, returning 0.
- Handle non-numeric elements in the `nums` list.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `nums` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `nums` input.
- Handle non-numeric elements in the `nums` list.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
