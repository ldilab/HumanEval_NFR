# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and other potential errors.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `file_name` as input.
- It returns a string, either 'Yes' or 'No'.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return 'Yes' if the file's name is valid, and 'No' otherwise.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `file_name` string, returning 'No'.
- Handle a `file_name` string with more than three digits, returning 'No'.
- Handle a `file_name` string with more than one dot, returning 'No'.
- Handle a `file_name` string where the substring before the dot is empty or does not start with a letter, returning 'No'.
- Handle a `file_name` string where the substring after the dot is not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'], returning 'No'.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `file_name` string.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string `file_name` input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
