# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should determine if it is possible to obtain a sorted array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations on the given array `arr`.
- If it is possible, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.
- If the given array is empty, the function should return `True`.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `arr`, returning `True`.
- Handle a single-element `arr`, returning `True`.
- Handle a sorted `arr`, returning `True`.
- Handle a reversed `arr`, returning `False`.
- Handle an unsorted `arr` with duplicate elements, returning `True` or `False` depending on the possibility of achieving non-decreasing order.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `arr` list.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `arr` input.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `arr` list.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `arr` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
