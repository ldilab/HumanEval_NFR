# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return the number of elements in `arr` that have a sum of digits greater than 0.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `arr` list, returning 0.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(nm) where n is the length of the `arr` list and m is the average number of digits in each element.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `arr` input.
- Handle non-integer elements in the `arr` list.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
