# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `test` as input.
- It returns a dictionary.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a dictionary where the keys are lowercase letters from the `test` string and the values are their respective counts in the string.
- If multiple letters have the same occurrence, all of them should be included in the dictionary.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty `test` string, returning an empty dictionary.
- Handle a `test` string with only spaces, returning an empty dictionary.
- Handle a `test` string with no lowercase letters, returning an empty dictionary.
- Handle a `test` string with all letters having the same count, returning a dictionary with all letters and their respective counts.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `test` string.
- Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of unique lowercase letters in the `test` string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string input.
- Handle a non-lowercase letter character in the `test` string.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
