# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes two strings `s0` and `s1` as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if both strings have the same characters, regardless of the order.
- The function should return False if the strings have different characters.

## Edge Cases
- Handle empty strings as input, returning False.
- Handle non-string inputs, returning False.
- Handle strings with duplicate characters.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n + m) where n is the length of `s0` and m is the length of `s1`.
- Space complexity: O(n + m) where n is the number of unique characters in `s0` and m is the number of unique characters in `s1`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string inputs.
- Handle empty strings as input.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
