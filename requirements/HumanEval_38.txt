# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string.
- The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string `s` as input and returns the decoded string.

## Expected Behavior
### encode_cyclic
- The function should encode the input string by cycling groups of three characters.
- The encoded string should be returned.

### decode_cyclic
- Currently, there is no implementation for the `decode_cyclic` function.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string as input, returning an empty string.
- Handle a string with length less than 3, returning the original string for the `encode_cyclic` function.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity:
  - encode_cyclic: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
  - decode_cyclic: No implementation yet.
- Space complexity:
  - encode_cyclic: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
  - decode_cyclic: No implementation yet.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input for both functions.
- Handle non-ascii characters in the input string.
- Handle strings with leading/trailing whitespace.
- Handle strings with only one or two characters in the `encode_cyclic` function.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
