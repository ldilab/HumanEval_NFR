# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `s` as input.
- It returns a string as output.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return an ordered version of the input string `s`, where all words (separated by spaces) are replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on their ASCII value.
- The order of words and blank spaces in the sentence should be preserved.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty string as input, returning an empty string.
- Handle input strings with no words, returning the input string.
- Handle input strings with multiple spaces between words, treating them as a single space.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n log m) where n is the length of the input string `s` and m is the average length of the words in `s`.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string input.
- Handle special characters and non-alphabetic characters in the input string.
