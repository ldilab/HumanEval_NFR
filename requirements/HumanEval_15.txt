# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes an integer `n` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a space-delimited string of numbers starting from 0 up to `n` (inclusive).

## Edge Cases
- Handle negative `n` values, returning an empty string.
- Handle non-integer `n` values, returning an empty string.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the value of `n`.
- Space complexity: O(n).

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-integer `n` input.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while looping from 0 to `n`.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
