# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a positive integer `N` as input.
- It returns a string representation of the sum of the digits of `N` in binary.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should convert the given positive integer `N` to binary.
- It should calculate the sum of the digits in the binary representation of `N`.
- The function should return the binary representation of the sum of the digits.

## Edge Cases
- Handle the case where `N` is 0, returning "0".
- Handle the case where `N` is 1, returning "1".
- Handle the case where `N` is a large positive integer, such as 10000.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(log N), where N is the value of `N`.
- Space complexity: O(log N), where N is the value of `N`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large inputs, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input or a negative `N`.
- Handle the case where `N` exceeds the given constraint of 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.

### Reliability
- Avoid arithmetic errors, such as overflow, while performing calculations.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: ≤ 10.
