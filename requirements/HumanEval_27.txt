# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a string `string` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return a new string where lowercase characters in the input string are flipped to uppercase and uppercase characters are flipped to lowercase.

## Edge Cases
- Handle an empty input string, returning an empty string.
- Handle an input string with no alphabetical characters, returning the input string unchanged.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely long input strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle a non-string input.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing string characters.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 5.
