# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, key errors, and any other errors that might occur.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a dictionary as input.
- It returns a boolean value.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return True if all keys in the dictionary are either strings in lower case or strings in upper case.
- If the dictionary is empty, the function should return False.

## Edge Cases
- Handle a non-dictionary input, returning False.
- Handle dictionaries with keys that are not strings, returning False.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of keys in the dictionary.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large dictionaries, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-string keys in the dictionary.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
