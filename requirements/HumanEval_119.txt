# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a list of two strings `lst` as input.
- It returns a string.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should return 'Yes' if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in `lst` in some order to create a good string, and 'No' otherwise.
- A good string is defined as a string where all parentheses are balanced.

## Edge Cases
- Handle empty strings in `lst`, returning 'Yes' since an empty string is considered balanced.
- Handle strings with no parentheses in `lst`, returning 'Yes' since a string with no parentheses is considered balanced.
- Handle strings with unbalanced parentheses in `lst`, returning 'No' since it is not possible to create a good string.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the longest string in `lst`.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the longest string in `lst`.
- Ensure efficiency even for extremely large strings, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-list `lst` input or strings in `lst` that are not instances of str.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
