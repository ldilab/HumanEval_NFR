# Problem Agnostic Requirements
- Ensure error-free execution, avoiding type errors, index errors, arithmetic operation errors (e.g., division by zero, overflow), and so on.
- Demonstrate efficiency in the algorithmic approach to problem-solving.
- Code should be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand and maintain.

# Functional Requirements
## Input-output Conditions
- The function takes a positive integer `n` as input.
- It returns an integer.

## Expected Behavior
- The function should create an integer array `a` of length `n` using the given formula.
- It should count the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` of `a` where `i < j < k` and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3.
- It should return the final count of valid triples.

## Edge Cases
- Handle negative `n` values, returning 0.
- Handle non-integer `n` values, returning 0.
- Handle large `n` values efficiently, providing results within 5 seconds.

# Non-functional Requirements
## Performance
- Time complexity: O(n^3) where n is the value of `n`.
- Space complexity: O(n).
- Ensure efficiency even for large values of `n`, providing results within 5 seconds.

## Specific Quality Requirements
### Robustness
- Handle non-integer input values for `n`.
- Handle non-positive input values for `n`.

### Reliability
- Avoid index errors while accessing `a` elements.

### Maintainability
- Target Cyclomatic Complexity: â‰¤ 10.
